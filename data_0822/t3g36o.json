I would appreciate any tips, resources, breathing exercises, cartoons to play in the background, literally anything to help me focus and snap out of my dissociated state. I have been mostly focused on organizing, going to protests, donations, support, contacting friends and family and other things I can do at a distance, but I feel myself burning out and I still need to work. I informed my PI about the situation and my mental state, but I don’t expect him to be too understanding and he has left me on read so far (lol). I don’t have access to a psychologist unfortunately as there are huge waiting lists, but I have been trying. I just feel this huge cloud hanging over my head and it’s hard not to feel utterly devastated, although I am trying to keep my spirits to support others.\n\nedit: I’ve edited the post to reflect the fact that I am talking about the stress I’m feeling about the current war Russia is waging in Ukraine, not sure if it was clear.",
