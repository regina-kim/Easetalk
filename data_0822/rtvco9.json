  "concern": "Elementary or hs. Is there anyone that knows for sure they're gonna be in the future? Why do you want to be?\n\nFrom helpful videos I saw, it seems that preschool is pretty much about caring for the kids.\n\nFor elementary, a helpful youtuber said that the main challenges were these,\n\n* There's too many kids\n* There's not enough time to teach everything\n* They don't have effective ways of teaching and so blames the kids\n* They don't like repeating things\n* Problem of expecting kids to be like adults when they're kids is silly\n\nI guess if I didn't like these, maybe I also won't go into  elementary. Are there any other common challenges with elementary teaching?\n\nHear that it's likely better in other countries so if went into elementary in the future, would do it in other countries\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThought that I would like elementary more, but now I think would like preschool more\n\nOne preschool teacher was deciding between being a lawyer or a preschool teach and became a preschool teacher. There seems to be a bunch of preschool and homeschool videos that seem to be rlly good of ppl that review  teaching resources stuff instead of all the other ppl who just complains online on some sites\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a hs compared to elementary video, another helpful person said that there was a story in teaching hs where a student was excited about her clay project, but then when saw the teacher, became embarrassed to be excited about her clay project. This shows the damage and harm that some elementary teachers have done to kids\n\nI wasn't thinking about teaching hs in the future, and this is a good story that makes me think I'd like elementary much more than hs teaching. But atm, I like both less because it doesn't seem like too good of a life choice, but I'm not sure yet\n\nMaybe a principle or something would be a better idea. I dunno anymore\n\nWhat do you love about teaching, and why did you go into it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA helpful special ed teacher mostly said,\n\n* They had to use some of kind of \"research base program\" but it was mostly outdated since kids can't choose the readings they like\n* And it was boring to the kids since it was chosen for them and they can't choose it. And so become unrelatable to kids\n* They also said there was more paperwork, and since it was legal, it was stressful to them. I don't understand why it'd be stressful. They also said that they had a little bit of anxiety. I don't know if it was genetic  anxiety\n\nI wasn't thinking about special ed but saw this helpful video too",
