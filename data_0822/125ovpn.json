The end of this week, the week before the grant is due, my PI, co-mentor and I will meet to discuss if I have enough useable preliminary data to submit in April or if I’d have to wait until August. I’ve spent so much energy working on this grant since Feb. It’s consumed my life. I’ve skipped social plans and club rehearsals. After my birthday in march I worked 13 days straight only to hear that I need more data/ my data needed to be analyzed in a different way. What’s the point of this if the only thing I get from it is a shiny bullet point on a resume? I’m feeling jaded. The other third year in my lab (with a really good project and tons of prelim data) got a borderline score so he has no idea if he will get funded or not.",
