I’m not sure if this is the route for me. I want to help people, and help the environment, and I do enjoy medicine. I like the idea of law but law seems over saturated. I really enjoy the humanities and sciences. I’m not good at math. I tried computer science, physics and failed in those majors. Nursing is my third major and I’m still wondering if this is right for me. My family and friends think I’m good at art and writing. And I don’t know if I can make a living doing those things.
