  "concern": "Iâ€™ve officially just joined my lab and Iâ€™ve been having a rough first couple months trying to get a complicated  cloning project to work. Iâ€™m inexperienced in molecular cloning, but Iâ€™m now on my twelfth (!) attempt and Iâ€™m feeling very down and itâ€™s hard not to take it to heart. \n\nIâ€™ve made various mistakes along the way. Once, on attempt 9 I did something truly stupid (wrong antibiotic lol) but I caught and fixed it quickly and it just took a few extra hours. Once we ran out of a key reagent because someone left an empty tube in a box and never ordered more (it was difficult to see it was empty before I thawed it) so I had to start over. Another time the undergrad intern used all 30 vials of the bacteria I needed the morning I needed them, without informing anyone. So my fault for only checking the freezer the morning of the experiment and not immediately before starting, but also in my opinion this is a broader lab organization issue. The other times were issues by relying on protocols that were not well-optimized for my project (par for the course I guess). The latest is that I now need to re-design most of my strategy as I was following the instructions of someone who did a cloning project with the same backbone only to find that their instructions were incorrect and ignored a key gene in the vector. This is something I feel awful for not catching sooner in hindsight but again, I am inexperienced so it did not jump out to me until my PI finally noticed it today. \n\nIâ€™m not repeating the same mistakes but the sheer number of mistakes on the same step of a project is making me feel like Iâ€™m the problem. Itâ€™s driving me crazy and I keep going back and forth on how much of it is my fault or just unfortunate.\n\nTLDR: How do you guys handle the kind of mistakes where you donâ€™t know what you can do better except gain knowledge and experience over time? How do you not cry in the shower everyday? Send help ðŸ˜‚",
