  "concern": "So I currently live with my parents who are gonna retire. They are pretty much kicking me out and I don’t know what to do. I contacted my school about getting into a dorm for spring but I was told I would need an additional $10k after FASFA but I can’t afford that. My parents won’t agree to a parent plus loan and application for scholarships ended before I even got accepted. What do I do?\n\nEdit: to everyone saying to get a job, I am starting one tomorrow but even saving every check will not be enough to cover these expenses not to mention the things I would need to bring into the dorm",
