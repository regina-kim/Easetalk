  "concern": "Hi all,\n\nI am an MBA student in the back half of my program with 4 classes left. I am in the second most challenging class in the degree supposedly at the moment, and while it is a lot of work it didn't seem tough when given the time at the beginning of the semester. The issue is, I haven't been able to put the time in to succeed and it is really hitting me mentally, I can't decide what to do at the moment. \n\nI recently lost both my great aunt and uncle (basically my grandparents, the closest people in my life outside of my immediate family) within two weeks of each other and have had to travel across the USA to support my family and be there as my aunt passed away at the end. For reference, my aunt and uncle lived in the northeast while my family is located in southern FL. My immediate family is extremely close and my mother has been away from the family providing care every step of the way in conjunction with Hospice, not leaving their side since her arrival there in early September. On top of this, my maternal grandparents and maternal uncle (who have been mentally abusive of my mother for my entire life, the reason we moved down south) have been treating the family terribly and causing additional stress for my family and quite frankly I don't know how my mother has been able to deal with this whole thing. My uncle is a troublemaker who has been enabled throughout his life by my grandparents and has been to jail a few times for various issues that should have landed him more time in lockup. The conflict this time is over the fact certain people were not included in the will, and my mom is being blamed for us having control of the estate. We had a bat by the door the whole time we were at my great aunt and uncle's house and all decided nobody is leaving mom alone and we needed to be ready in case he showed up to cause issues. \n\nI say all this to mention that while I stayed there (4 weeks) from the beginning of October to a few days ago, I had no access to the internet on the trip minus randomly stopping at a local community college to try and do some work one day for class. Essentially every waking moment I was there I was with the family and trying to provide support for my mom, and I lost track of this class and got so far behind that I feel like I can't claw my way back at this point. I can drop the course, but I feel as if I am an abject failure for doing so. I thought about dropping earlier in the trip but figured I'd be able to get back on track when we left, but we stayed longer than anticipated and I feel as if that isn't the case.\n\n I'm 26 and feel like I should be done with my degree already, I don't want to put myself back by a semester when I am nearing the finish line, but I'm not sure what to do. I haven't completely coped with the situation to this point and am just looking for some insights or perspective on this. I am planning on having a conversation over the phone with my professor on Thursday, and my advisor has mentioned I can get out of the class affecting my degree given the circumstances. It still just makes me feel like I'm screwing myself so hard and wasting time. \n\nSorry for being long-winded. \n\nGot any ways to deal with the guilt of potentially dropping a class, and have any advice?",

I’ll try reaching out like that and just keep it simple, see how it goes from there. I’m still kinda stressed about how far behind I am overall, though, not just with the project. Like, even if I get back into this, I’m not sure I can handle the rest of the workload right now.\ntherapist: It's understandable to feel stressed about the overall workload, especially after being away for a while. Remember that taking small steps towards catching up, like reaching out to your teammate, can help build momentum and reduce feelings of overwhelm. Have you thought about what other small steps you could take to ease back into your coursework?\nclient: client: Honestly, I haven’t really figured out any other steps yet; I’m just kinda stuck on feeling like it’s all too much to even start. Maybe I could break things down into smaller chunks or something, but I’m not sure where to begin with that.\ntherapist: Breaking things down into smaller, manageable chunks can be a great way to start tackling the workload. One option might be to make a list of all the tasks you need to complete and then prioritize them based on importance and urgency. Another approach could be to set aside dedicated blocks of time each day or week to focus on specific tasks, so you're not trying to do everything at once. You could also consider reaching out to your professors or a campus support service for additional guidance and resources. What do you think might work best for you?\nclient: client: I think making a list and prioritizing stuff could help, like just seeing it all laid out might make it less overwhelming. I’m not sure about the time blocks yet, but maybe I’ll try talking to my professor during our call to get a better idea of what’s most urgent.\nclient: Cool, I’m glad you think the list idea could work for getting a handle on things. Do you have any tips on how to not get totally stressed out while I’m figuring out what to prioritize?\nclient: Thanks for the suggestion about making a list; I think it’ll really help me get a clearer picture. Do you have any quick tips for staying calm while I sort through everything and decide what to tackle first?\nclient: I’m really glad you think the list will help clear things up. One quick tip for staying calm is to take short breaks when you feel your stress building—maybe step away for a few minutes, breathe deeply, or grab a quick snack to reset. How do you usually handle moments when you’re feeling overwhelmed?\nclient: Hey, thanks for the tip about taking short breaks—that sounds like something I can definitely try. I usually just push through when I’m overwhelmed, but I’m starting to see that might not be the best way, so I’m curious if there’s anything else you’d suggest for keeping my head clear?\nclient: Thanks for the suggestion about breaks; I’m definitely gonna give that a shot since pushing through hasn’t been working so well. Do you have any other ideas for staying grounded when things start piling up?\nclient: Thanks for the ideas; I’m really open to trying anything that might help me stay balanced. Do you think something like a quick mindfulness exercise could work, or is there another trick you’ve seen help in situations like this?\nclient: Thanks for being open to these suggestions; I’m glad you’re willing to experiment with what might work. I think a quick mindfulness exercise could be a great idea—do you have any experience with that, or would you want some guidance on how to start?\nclient: Thanks for the suggestion about mindfulness; I’m definitely interested in giving it a shot. I don’t have much experience with it, so I’d appreciate any guidance on how to get started.\nclient: Hey, I’m really glad you’re open to helping me with this mindfulness stuff. Could you maybe walk me through a simple exercise or point me to some resources to get started?\nclient: Hey, I’m really grateful for your help with this mindfulness idea. Could you share a quick exercise or maybe recommend an app or video to guide me through the basics?\nclient: Hey, thanks for the ideas on mindfulness exercises and resources; I’m excited to try them out. Do you think starting with just a few minutes a day could still make a difference, or should I aim for longer sessions right away?\nclient: Thanks for the input on starting small with mindfulness; I think that sounds manageable. Do you have any tips on how to build it into a routine without feeling overwhelmed?\nclient: Hey, I’m really glad we’re figuring this out together. Do you have any advice on making mindfulness a regular thing without it feeling like just another task on my to-do list?",
