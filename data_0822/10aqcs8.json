  "concern": "So this is a long story and I'm currently in a bit of a unique situation because of which there's no one irl who i can ask for reliable advice so as much as reddit is really not the place to be asking for advice on life changing decisions i've got no other options and here we go.\n\n**TDLR:  was a good student, went to horrible uni and tried to survive. now burnt out, looking to transfer but bc of horrid uni application is fucked. thinking of dropping out want to know abt how likelihood of job opportunities for foreign drop-outs. read passages marked \\* for a longer summary**\n\n**\\*** The story basically goes that, I am an Indian citizen, but i've lived my whole life abroad so i know as much about India as ur next door neighbour + like 5%, okay. At the end of high school, I blindly trusted my parents' suggestion and got into and started attending a top 10 indian uni which has now become the single worst decision i've ever made in my entire life.\n\nAs it turned out, my uni is 100% fucked up. I could go on abt it for days but we don't have time to give a short summary of the vibes: extreme mismanagement of an institution, horrible facilities/classrooms, no sense of academic integrity, poor teaching, no sort of proper functioning basic 'services' like student welfare or career counselors provided, straight up illegal shit like holding classes in a construction site, the fact that you DON'T HAVE WIFI NOR DOES MOBILE DATA WORK BC NETWORK IS SO BAD on campus, the list goes on.\n\nGetting back to my situation, my first year was online and EVERYONE cheated on EVERYTHING but I didn't know how to so I didn't and ended up with the lower side of decent kinda grades (mainly bc most of the syllabus was geared to start off from what was taught in the Indian curriculum that I obv didn't study and so there were large gaps in my knowledge that I wasn't even aware of). For detail, I averaged a 8.33/10 CGPA.\n\nIn my 2nd year, we went irl, I got my shit together, worked super hard but bc there is literally no sense of fair grading and cheating is rampant at my uni, so my efforts have only given mediocre results. (I got a 8.73/10 GPA in that sem, now averaging 8.46). This added with overwork (my uni is 6 days a week, 1 month holiday for summer, 1 week for winter, sometimes we do 7 days a week working and the semesters are back-to-back i.e. after the last day of sem 3, the next day is sem 4), I am super burned out rn with v low morale.\n\n**\\*** I've decided to transfer but I have a v weak application, I only focused on studying and I do computer science so I need projects/stuff to appear as a suitable candidate. I am generally quiet and mainly focused on self-learning bc of my low-quality classes so my letter of recommendations is also super weak. Ofc i do have potential, i am smart, i am hard working, i am capable. But my situation for the past 2 years has been HORRENDOUS and unfortunately no uni is going to understand that. After all i go to a top10 uni, hundreds of fully capable candidates graduate from there every year and i am the only one making excuses.\n\n**\\*** My only other option is to drop out. But my main priority is to leave India bc I cannot live here on my own like i don't know the language or the customs, etc and unlike every other country i've lived in you can't just google get straight forward answers for things in India which is the only survival method i've learnt. Which basically means if I drop out, I would have to learn computer science on my own and get a job abroad and i've never heard of anyone do that or the prospects of that path so I am super unsure.\n\nThis post has been an absolute mess but if anyone could help i'd appreciate it so so much.",
