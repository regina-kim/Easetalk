I can't afford a degree without funding, but (A) gave me an offer that expires on June, and (B) funding will be determined on April-June. I don't know how to interact with my supervisors from (A), they are exited and waiting on my reply, but I don't know how to tell them they became my 2nd choice, and that's I'm waiting on a funding decision from my top choice, and if I received it I will go with (B) not them and if I didn't receive it, I will return to them.\n\nIt is weird situation",
