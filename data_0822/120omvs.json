  "concern": "Hii, I'm currently a junior majoring in CW and have always wanted to attend grad school. My current GPA is 2.7, and my bad grades came from 3-4 classes that I wasn't mentally thriving in. I did some calculations, and the highest GPA I can achieve (if passing all future classes with A's) would be around 3.12. I do think I can achieve it (sacrificing social and personal life sigh) but the grad school I want to attend has a \"Most successful applicants to our program have a GPA of 3.7\" in their application descriptions. It's quite demotivating. I do have some good writing works/stories with contracts with an ePublishing company. I don't know why I'm saying this. I'm really scared I'll be pushed to the side because of my GPA. \n\nShould I just give up on the university, and look for another college? The GPA statement really lowered my hopes. \n\n(The university I want to go to is UW if anyone is wondering.)",
