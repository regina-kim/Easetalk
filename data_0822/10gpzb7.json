  "concern": "What’s popping reddit\n\nI’m 25 years old. And I just got my license to practice as a nurse. I’m pretty late because I got diagnosed with OCD and it absolutely turned my life around. It took a lot of work to finally get to the point of taking and passing the NCLEX, but we’re here. \n\nHowever, a huge, huge dream of mine, is to eventually practice as an Psych NP. \n\nI wanted to practice as a nurse for a year (as recommended) go to school full time, and be done within 2 years instead of 4. This trajectory would let me graduate at 29-31 years old. \n\nGetting my own place would make grad school difficult, no doubt. I’d have to cut hours in my job, pay my bills somehow, go to clinicals after work/do homework as well. It would just make life a lot harder\n\nIf I stayed, I wouldn’t have to pay rent. I could pay some chunks off my loans, go to school full time and work part time so I’d save cash. The stress of trying to survive and keep it all together wouldn’t be there, which leaves me more time to focus on school.\n\nHowever, that’s a long time with my parents. Everywhere I see, everyone advocates moving out and getting your life together on your own. I really can’t help but feel like a loser. \n\nBut at the same time, If I just stay an RN, I’m not making the money or living the life I want. I prob wouldn’t stay in the city I’m in and love and would move to somewhere more affordable. And this would be all for society accepting me for independence \n\nMy dating life and social life would prob suffer due to judgment from being home as well. I just don’t know…",
