  "concern": "Hi I’m 18 m turning 19 in august and I have to make a choice about college. I have been accepted into my 3rd and 4th choice colleges and I now need to decide if I am gonna take another gap year or go to college this fall.\n\nI would like to go to college as soon as possible but I really want to try and get in to my 1st or 2nd choice schools as they are both 80,000$ cheaper then the other 2 and in a better location\nI plan to go for aviation/flight management to be a pilot at all schools \n\nI am worried about staying another year as all my friends are going to college this year and I would really like to move out and live on my own also I fear I might not get accepted next year if I stay\n\nFor the cost my parents have set aside enough money to afford the 80,000$ schools but I feel bad making them spend that much when I could try to get into a far cheaper and better school \n\nThe best schools for my program are my 1st and 2nd choice schools the (cheaper ones)\n\nAlso I am in Ontario Canada and all the schools are also in Ontario Canada if it matters \n\nHope this all made sense all advice is appreciated \nIf you have any questions please ask \n\nThanks again ",
