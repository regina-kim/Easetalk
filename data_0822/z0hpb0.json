I will spiral into depression and panic if I don't do that well on a test or get B's and C's, even if I only need at D to pass. \n\nFor my major (CS), my GPA doesn't matter a whole lot but I still can't shake the need to get and maintain a 4.0. I want to be able to enjoy extracurriculars, hobbies and things outside of school but I feel trapped by my own mind.",
