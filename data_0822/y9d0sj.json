(18) It wasn't even my room either it was some dumbasses room and these dudes started fighting in there. Long story short the RA's were called and I was caught, and put on probation. Now if I get caught again I'll probably be kicked out of here or worse. \n\nNone of my other friends have probation like me so they're just living their lives care free, while I'm paranoid to even go to another person's place. I don't know I feel like none of this was even deserved on my part, and even tonight I was invited to do drinking games with some other friends. Should I even go? I'm so nervous and upset. Probation lasts a whole year man... GOD",
