It's amazing how sometimes stepping back can allow us to approach things with a clearer mind and a renewed sense of focus. What steps do you think you might take once you’ve given yourself that time to process, and how can we work together to build a plan that aligns with your values and priorities?\nclient: I’m glad to hear that, and yeah, I think this breather is already making a difference. Honestly, once I’ve got some time after the defense, I’d like to sit down and really think about what this name change means to me personally and professionally, maybe list out the pros and cons. I’m not sure yet what specific steps I’ll take, but I’d love to bounce ideas off you and figure out how to balance everything that’s important to me. How do you think we could start mapping that out?\ntherapist: One way we could start is by creating a list of the things that are most important to you, both personally and professionally, and then use that as a guide to evaluate the pros and cons of a name change. We could also brainstorm some specific steps you might take, like researching the process or talking to friends or colleagues, and then work on prioritizing those steps based on your values and priorities. What do you think about starting with that?\nclient: I think that sounds like a really solid starting point. I’m kinda excited to get into listing out what matters most to me and seeing how it all connects to this decision, so yeah, let’s start there and see where it takes us.\nclient: Cool, I’m glad we’ve got a plan to kick things off. So, when do you think we should meet next to dive into this list and start brainstorming?",
