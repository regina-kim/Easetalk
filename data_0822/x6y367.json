  "concern": "\nI want to post this because I've been feeling this way for a while and wanted to know if others have experienced this. I'm (20M) an Arab international student in Los Angeled, and I can't help but wonder if there's a huge disconnect between international students and Americans (and other Natives in other countries).\n\nI've been at my particular University for 2 years in person at this point in time, and it feels like when I try to make friends with Americans, they expect to not relate to me and so immediately put up a barrier with me, which makes it difficult to connect with anyone on campus. It sort of feels like they're expecting huge cultural differences, which I don't fully blame them for. Part of it is international students clinging on to each other, and part of it is just expecting to not connect. I would see my other American friends have other people approach them, whereas I would approach people and be dealt with distance and uninterest.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Have you experienced or witnessed anything along these lines?",
