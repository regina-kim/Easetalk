  "concern": "So I got my MA in History in May, 2021, from a terminal program - but I wasn't accepted to any of the PhD programs I applied to, my advisor and I were pretty sure, because of all the schools in 2020-21 who froze PhD admissions altogether to conserve funding for current students during the pandemic causing a snowball effect that everyone who applied to those schools (i.e Cornell) to apply to other schools they wouldn't have initially. \n\nSo here I am, unemployed because minimum wage places won't hire me (\"Overqualified\") and without the certification to teach history in a high school or do anything with my degree applying to PhD programs again. In the time since the last admissions round, I've signed a deal with a publisher to publish my MA thesis as a book, which is due out in June, but hasn't been listed for pre-order or sale anywhere yet to prove that it's real to admission committees and not just a CV invention, so I'm worried that won't be enough to give me a leg up in admissions. My MA GPA was a 4.0, but my undergrad GPA was absolutely awful. \n\nI have received one email from a member of an admissions committee from one of the schools I applied to asking whether \"the retirement of \\[a professor I had expressed interest in working in\\] would affect whether or not you choose to attend\" that school. \n\nAm I panicking unnecessarily? Has the worry about conserving money for existing students let up at various universities? Do I just need to take a xanax and relax until March when I'll hear yes or no definitively?",

Would you be open to giving it a try, even just for a few minutes each day?\nclient: Yeah, I’m willing to give journaling a shot, even if it’s just for a few minutes. I like the idea of a prompt to keep me from spiraling too much—maybe it’ll help get some of this mess out of my head. Do you think I should, like, write about specific stuff each day, or just whatever’s bugging me at the moment? And honestly, if it doesn’t work and I still feel stuck, what else could I try to just… I don’t know, feel less like I’m drowning in all this waiting and worrying?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're really open to finding ways to manage your stress and anxiety, which is a great first step. As for journaling, you could start by writing about whatever's on your mind that day—just let your thoughts flow without worrying too much about structure or coherence. If you find that's not working for you, you could try focusing on specific themes, like your goals or the things you're grateful for. And remember, there are lots of other things you could try if journaling doesn't work for you—maybe some deep breathing exercises, meditation, or even talking to a friend or family member about how you're feeling.\nclient: Cool, I appreciate the flexibility with the journaling approach—starting with whatever’s on my mind feels less intimidating than having a set topic. I’m curious about the deep breathing or meditation stuff you mentioned; I’ve never really tried that before, and I’m not sure if I’d just sit there feeling silly or if it’d actually help calm me down—can you walk me through how to even start with something like that?\ntherapist: That’s a great question, and it’s totally normal to feel a bit unsure about trying something new, especially when you’re already feeling overwhelmed. Deep breathing exercises can be a great way to start, since they’re simple and you can do them anywhere. One technique is called box breathing: you breathe in for four counts, hold it for four counts, breathe out for four counts, and hold again for four counts. It can help slow down your heart rate and give your mind a chance to catch up. If you’re feeling up to it, we can try it together right now, just for a minute or two.\nclient: **Client:** Hey, yeah, I'm down to try this box breathing thing with you right now—sounds pretty straightforward, and I could use something to slow down the chaos in my head. Walk me through it step by step, and, like, if I mess up or feel weird, is that okay, or should I be getting it right off the bat?\ntherapist: Of course, it's totally okay if it feels a bit awkward at first—just breathe however feels natural and comfortable, and don't worry about getting it 'perfect'. Let's start with a few rounds together: breathe in slowly through your nose for four counts, hold that breath for four counts, then exhale slowly through your mouth for four counts, and pause again for four counts. Ready when you are.\nclient: **Client:** Alright, I’m ready to give it a shot. Let’s do this together—count me through it, and I’ll follow along, even if I feel a bit off at first.\ntherapist: You're doing great—just keep that slow, steady rhythm. Let's start with the first round: breathe in through your nose for four counts... one... two... three... four. Hold that breath for four counts... one... two... three... four. Now exhale through your mouth for four counts... one... two... three... four. And hold again for four counts... one... two... three... four. Ready for the next round?\nclient: **Client:** Yeah, I'm ready for the next round—let's keep going. That first one felt a little strange, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of it, so just keep counting me through a couple more if that’s cool.\ntherapist: You're doing fantastic—your rhythm is smoothing out already! Let's keep going: breathe in through your nose for four counts... one... two... three... four. Hold that breath for four counts... one... two... three... four. Now exhale through your mouth for four counts... one... two... three... four. And hold again for four counts... one... two... three... four. One more round?\nclient: **Client:** Yeah, let’s do one more round—I’m feeling a bit calmer already, which is kinda surprising. Keep counting me through it, and maybe after this, we can chat about how to use this when I’m spiraling over the PhD stuff again.\ntherapist: Absolutely, I'm glad to hear you're feeling calmer. Let's move through one more round together, and after that, we can certainly talk about how to incorporate this technique when you're feeling overwhelmed about your PhD work. Ready for the final round? Breathe in through your nose for four counts... one... two... three... four. Hold that breath for four counts... one... two... three... four. Now exhale through your mouth for four counts... one... two... three... four. And hold again for four counts... one... two... three... four. Great job! Let's discuss how to use this technique to help you feel more centered when stress creeps in.\nclient: **Client:** Thanks, that last round really helped settle me down some more—I didn’t expect it to work this fast. So, like, how do I pull this out when I’m freaking out over PhD apps or whatever, especially when I’m just sitting at home alone overthinking everything?\ntherapist: Let's start by thinking about specific moments when the PhD stress kicks in—like when you're staring at application deadlines or scrolling through university websites. What if we practice the 4-4-4 breathing now, and I guide you through it like this: \"When you feel that spiral starting, take a breath in for four counts... hold it... and slowly exhale for four, letting the tension melt with each count.\" Would you like to try that together?\nclient: **Client:** Yeah, that sounds like a good idea—I'm definitely down to try it. Like, I know those moments hit hard when I’m just refreshing my email for updates or overanalyzing every word in my application, so let’s practice now while I’m still feeling kinda okay.\ntherapist: Let's practice the 4-4-4 breathing technique right now, tailored to those specific moments of stress. I'll guide you through it, and you can imagine yourself in one of those situations, like refreshing your email or overanalyzing your application. Ready? Breathe in through your nose for four counts... one... two... three... four. Hold that breath for four counts... one... two... three... four. Now exhale through your mouth for four counts... one... two... three... four. And hold again for four counts... one... two... three... four. How did that feel, especially imagining those moments?\nclient: **Client:** That felt pretty good, honestly—I could kinda picture myself in that email-refreshing spiral, and the breathing helped pull me back a bit. So, like, should I just do this every time I catch myself stressing, or is there a way to, I dunno, make it a habit before I even get to that point?\ntherapist: That's a great question. Building it into your routine—like before starting your PhD work or even during short breaks—could help prevent stress from building up. Maybe we could also brainstorm a few other ways to integrate this breathing technique into your daily life, like pairing it with something you already do, such as when you first sit down at your desk or right after you've finished a task. What do you think?\nclient: **Client:** Yeah, I like the idea of tying it to something I’m already doing, like maybe right when I sit down to check emails or after I finish writing a section of an application. Honestly, I’m just wondering if I’ll remember to do it when I’m in the middle of a freakout—do you have any tricks for that, or should I, like, set a reminder on my phone or something?\nclient: **Client:** Yeah, I think pairing it with daily stuff makes a lot of sense, and I’m willing to give it a shot. Do you have any other quick ideas for staying on track with it, especially when things get really hectic?",
