  "concern": "I am not sure if this is executive dysfunction or my severe anxiety or if they are reinforcing each other but here is my issue. I nearly failed my general chemistry class. I kept telling people that I tried my very best and I didn't know what happened but that is not the truth. I do know what happened. I got to a point where I just stopped doing the work because the idea of doing it made me so anxious. I would watch tv for hours and take naps knowing that I should be doing chemistry work but I couldn't because I felt so anxious. In anticipation of a midterm I would have really bad body aches and headaches as a manifestation of this anxiety. I tried writing down my thoughts and pushing through but it never worked long term. I would start reading the textbook and then stop after 10 minutes because I just couldn't do it anymore. It was like a mixture of anxiety and boredom that was making feel like it was unbearable to do. I have to do better this semester to save my gpa but I don't know how to push through these feelings especially since therapy is not accessible to me at the moment.",
