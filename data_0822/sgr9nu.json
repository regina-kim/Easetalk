  "concern": "So first time I took the comp exam (civil engineering), I was told I passed! I told everyone and celebrated and moved on with my life.\n\n2 weeks after grades were posted I was told it was a clerical error and that I did not pass. I was crushed, as you can imagine. What made things even worse was when more people would congratulate me after I found out it was an error. I decided not to tell anyone of this error (except my wife and parents) in hopes that I would pass the second attempt.\n\nUnfortunately, I failed that test too. So now, the committee has given me another opportunity to get my hard earned diploma. I don't know if this is common, or that they're just giving me a break for crushing my life after informing me of the clerical error mishap. The task is an oral exam with a single written question on the most difficult course I've taken, and I'm which I did the absolute worst in.\n\nThe test is in less than a month, and I have approximately 3 full weekends to study and I have been given big hints for the question.\n\nI am now in the works of pairing with a professional tutor and am preparing all my questions for the time with the tutor.\n\nI have been really unable to sleep through the night these passed few days from the severe anxiety I am feeling. So, what should I do during the week that I am not working with the tutor?\n\nShould I just continue to review during the week? Btw I have a full time demanding engineering job at which I come home around 7:30 during the week.\n\nSorry if I'm all over the place, I just want to know what I should do so I can finally put this behind me.\n\nEdit- I passed the exam! Thanks to everyone's support and for sharing their experience with me.",
