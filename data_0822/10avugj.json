  "concern": "\\[Warning: Some self-pity involved; Tl;DR: Can't seem to find an internship leading me to become a financial burden to my parents.\\]\n\nAs the title suggests, I have been struggling to find an internship for the past few months now. Before I get into the details, I'll provide a bit of background.\n\nI'm currently a second and final year MSc Biology (2 yrs) international student in the Netherlands, and the way my program is designed, each year I am supposed to find an internship in order to progress and eventually graduate. The university recommends us to do the first internship in-house, meaning under the Faculty of Science and your respective department, only then for the second/last internship you get to choose to do the internship in a company or another university (company or university can be locally or internationally, students have the option). \n\nI successfully completed my first internship already back in September 2022 and ever since then have been stuck in a hole trying to find an internship here in western Europe. I have tried companies locally and several neighboring countries as well as universities (across the Netherlands) but my efforts have proven to be fruitless thus far. Companies either do not reply or that they are not hiring during this period. In the meantime, I have just been calling and sending emails on a daily basis, even spoke to my program/study advisor who gave me useful advice and suggestions but still nothing to show. Hell, I have even tried approaching/connecting with potential employers via Linkedin after receiving such advice but apparently for some I require the premium package, which I do not have, in order to send them a message\n\nI feel like a failure because it's now January 2023 and due to my internship being a mandatory 6-month period in order to get the credits, this all means that I will definitely be graduating late. That, in turn, means more burden on my parents to financially support me. I just don't know what to do when the companies and the people I send my emails to do not reply at all.",

Iâ€™m confident we can work together to explore new strategies or perspectives that might help break this cycleâ€”youâ€™re not doomed to keep struggling.\n\nI just feel so drained, you know? Like, I want to keep pushing, but every day feels heavier, and Iâ€™m starting to wonder if Iâ€™m even cut out for this. Do you think thereâ€™s a point where I should just step back and rethink everything, or is that giving up?\ntherapist: Itâ€™s clear how much this struggle has taken out of you, and itâ€™s understandable to question whether pushing through is the right move. Letâ€™s sit with that feeling for a momentâ€”what do you think stepping back might give you that pushing forward right now isnâ€™t? And on the flip side, what would be the hardest part about letting go of the path youâ€™re on, even temporarily?\nclient: Honestly, stepping back might give me a chance to just breathe, you know, like take the pressure off for a bit and maybe figure out if thereâ€™s another way to approach this whole internship mess. But the hardest part about letting go, even just for a little while, would be feeling like Iâ€™m admitting defeat, and Iâ€™m terrified of disappointing my parents even more than I already have. What if I step back and then canâ€™t get back on track? I just donâ€™t know if Iâ€™d be able to handle that.\ntherapist: I hear the fear of defeat and the pressure to please your parents, and it's clear that stepping back feels like a heavy, risky move. What if we reframed this pause not as giving up, but as a strategic resetâ€”a chance to recharge and come back stronger? Have you thought about what support systems might help you navigate this reset, even if it's just for a little while?\nclient: Yeah, I hadnâ€™t really thought of it as a strategic reset beforeâ€”that kinda makes it feel less like failing. I guess I could lean on friends or maybe even talk more with my study advisor about taking a short break, but Iâ€™m still worried about how to explain this to my parents without them thinking Iâ€™m just giving up. Do you think thereâ€™s a way to frame this to them so it doesnâ€™t sound like Iâ€™m slacking off? I just donâ€™t want them to worry even more.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're beginning to see that taking a break doesn't have to be a negative thing, but a way to regroup and recharge. It might help to approach the conversation with your parents from a place of honesty and vulnerability, emphasizing your desire to make the best decision for your future and your willingness to work with them to find a solution.\nclient: Yeah, I like the idea of being honest with them, but Iâ€™m still kinda nervous about how theyâ€™ll react since theyâ€™re already stressed about supporting me. I just wanna make sure they see Iâ€™m not throwing in the towel, you know? How do I even start that convo without it turning into a lecture about how I need to try harder? I feel like Iâ€™m already doing everything I can, and I donâ€™t know how to make them get that.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you're worried about how your parents might react, but approaching them with honesty and a clear plan for your reset could help them see your perspective. What if you started the conversation by acknowledging their concerns and then explaining how this break could ultimately help you succeed in the long run?\nclient: Yeah, that makes senseâ€”acknowledging their worries first might help ease them into the idea that Iâ€™m not just giving up. I think I could try saying something like, I know youâ€™ve been supporting me a lot, and Iâ€™m working on a plan to make sure I donâ€™t let you down, but I need a short break to figure out the best way forward. Do you think that sounds okay, or should I add more about what Iâ€™ll do during the break so they donâ€™t think Iâ€™m just sitting around? Iâ€™m just so scared theyâ€™ll think Iâ€™m wasting time, you know?\ntherapist: That sounds like a great way to start the conversation, but you might consider adding a few specific details about how you plan to use the break to recharge and refocusâ€”like mentioning your intention to set goals, seek support, or practice self-careâ€”to help your parents understand that this isn't a passive step back. How do you feel about incorporating those ideas into your explanation?\nclient: I think adding those details could really help, like telling them Iâ€™ll be working on my applications with a clearer head or maybe even taking a short course to boost my skills. Iâ€™m just wondering if thatâ€™ll be enough to convince them Iâ€™m still on track, or if I should prepare for some pushback anyway, you know?\ntherapist: You've got some great ideas to include in your conversation with your parents. Remember, you can't control their reactions, but you can control how you present your plan. Preparing for potential pushback might help you feel more confident, and it's okay to acknowledge their concerns while still standing firm in your decision. How do you think you might handle their questions or worries if they do arise?\nclient: I guess Iâ€™d try to stay calm and just keep explaining that this break isnâ€™t me giving up, but more like a way to make sure Iâ€™m moving forward in the right direction. Iâ€™d probably say something like, I get why youâ€™re worried, but I really believe this will help me come back strongerâ€”can we talk about how I can keep you updated on my progress? How do you think I should respond if they still push back hard, like if they start saying Iâ€™m just making excuses? Iâ€™m kinda worried Iâ€™ll freeze up or get defensive if it gets too heated.\ntherapist: You've already shown great insight in recognizing that staying calm and reiterating your commitment to progress is key. If things escalate, try grounding yourself by taking a breath, and then refocus the conversation by asking them to share their concerns and listen attentivelyâ€”this can help de-escalate tensions. Remember, you're not alone in this; we can role-play potential scenarios if you'd like to practice.\nclient: I really appreciate the idea of taking a breath and listening to their concernsâ€”that sounds like it could help keep things from getting too heated. Iâ€™d definitely be up for role-playing some scenarios with you because Iâ€™m still nervous about freezing up or saying the wrong thing if they push hard. What kind of situations do you think we should practice? Like, should we focus on them accusing me of making excuses or maybe them just not understanding why I need a break at all? I just wanna feel prepared for whatever might come up, you know?\nclient: Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re open to practicing togetherâ€”itâ€™s a great way to build confidence. Maybe we could start with them not understanding the need for a break, since that feels like a common sticking point, and then move to handling accusations if thereâ€™s time? What do you think would be most helpful to tackle first? I just want to make sure Iâ€™m ready for the toughest parts of the convo.\nclient: Iâ€™m cool with starting wherever you think makes the most sense. Honestly, I just want to focus on whatever will help me feel most prepared for the trickier moments, so if you think one scenario is more likely or tougher, letâ€™s dive into that first.\nclient: therapist: Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re eager to dive in and build that confidence. Letâ€™s start with them not understanding the need for a break since it seems like a foundational issue that could set the tone for the rest of the conversation, and then we can tackle the accusations if time allows. Does that sound good to you?\n\nclient: Yeah, that sounds perfect. I think starting with their lack of understanding will help me get a handle on the core of the convo before moving to the tougher stuff.",
