  "concern": "In undergrad, I was on top of my shit. Gears changing constantly. Though the classes were easier, there were more of them and the subjects were more varied. Work/internship/research. Student organizations. Events and planning. Prep for professional life and grad school. Social life. So many things, and I rarely if ever dropped the ball. I felt like a machine. Fulfilling and purposeful work. We were all ready to change the world.\n\nIn grad school, dropping the ball has become business as usual. Throughout my department, people drop commitments without announcement, show up late to meetings, miss deadlines, and send emails after the fact - sometimes apologetic and others accusatory. Presentations and papers are thrown together last minute, and lectures are permeated with the constant undertone, \"There are much better uses of my time than this,\" from both instructors and students. Resources to prepare for industry or education (anything outside of research, really) are scant - treated as obligatory by the department - and those who seek them out are viewed as admitting burnout or a lack of commitment or skill. Research is carried out with petty comments and measuring contests. People trade shady favors, becoming authors of papers to which they didn't contribute and exchanging techniques to fudge numbers and buy time. Those who are seated in tenured research positions seem constantly frazzled. If you ever ask them how to develop yourself, where to find meaning, how to generate questions and goals, you get a weak laugh and some half-hearted talk for 5min. Watching them work has been like watching someone stuck in a bad marriage. The encouragements that have come my way feel like the lies people tell themselves while losing religion.\n\nI've never caved to academic dishonesty, but I can't deny that the lack of professionalism has rubbed off on me. It's hard for anyone to generate sincerity and drive in a system this demoralizing. What happened?? How do I dig out?",

I feel like I’m losing the drive and structure I used to have, and it’s hard to stay motivated in a place that feels so off.\n\nSo, like, I guess I’m wondering how I can keep my own standards and energy up when everyone else seems to be checked out or cutting corners? I don’t want to slip into that same mindset, but it’s tough not to when it’s all around me, you know?\ntherapist: It’s really admirable that you’re holding onto your own standards and values, even in a challenging environment. I can imagine it takes a lot of effort to keep your energy up when everyone else seems to be slipping. Can you tell me more about what’s helping you stay motivated so far, or maybe what used to work for you before this became a problem?\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate that. Honestly, what used to keep me going was this sense of purpose, like I was building toward something bigger, and the people around me in undergrad were on the same wavelength, pushing each other to do better.\n\nBut now, I feel like I’m just going through the motions, and it’s hard to find that same fire. What do you think I can do to kinda rebuild that sense of purpose when the environment isn’t giving me much to work with?\ntherapist: It's clear that your sense of purpose was deeply connected to the supportive environment and like-minded individuals you had in undergrad. I can see how losing that support system would make it difficult to maintain that drive. It might be helpful to explore what aspects of your purpose still resonate with you, even in this challenging environment, and how you can reconnect with those values.\nclient: Yeah, I think figuring out what still matters to me could help, even if the surroundings aren’t ideal. It’s just tough to pinpoint that when everything feels so off, you know?\n\nLike, I still care about my field and the impact I want to have, but the day-to-day grind and the attitudes around me make it hard to focus on the bigger picture. Do you have any ideas on how I can kinda zoom out and reconnect with those core reasons I started this journey in the first place?\ntherapist: That's a great question. One idea could be to create a personal reminder system, like a vision board or a short written statement, that highlights your core values and the impact you want to make in your field. By placing this in a visible spot, you can regularly reconnect with your bigger picture goals and values. Additionally, setting aside a specific time each week to reflect on your progress and how it aligns with your purpose might help you stay focused on the bigger picture despite the challenging day-to-day environment.\nclient: Thanks, I like the idea of having something tangible to keep me grounded, like a vision board or a written reminder. It’s just hard to imagine staying consistent with that when I’m already feeling so bogged down, you know?\n\nI guess I’m worried that even if I set up these reminders or carve out time to reflect, the negativity around me will still drag me down. How do I protect my headspace when it feels like I’m surrounded by apathy or worse every day?\ntherapist: It's understandable that you're concerned about the impact of negativity on your headspace, especially when you're already feeling overwhelmed. One strategy could be to identify specific people or environments that drain your energy and try to limit your exposure to them, while also actively seeking out positive influences or supportive networks that can help counterbalance the apathy. By creating a bit of distance from the negativity and nurturing more uplifting connections, you might find it easier to maintain your own motivation and focus on your bigger picture goals.\nclient: Thanks, that makes sense—trying to limit the draining stuff and find some positive vibes to balance things out. I just don’t know where to even start looking for those supportive connections when it feels like everyone around me is either checked out or caught up in the same mess.\n\nLike, I’ve thought about reaching out to old undergrad friends or maybe finding a mentor outside my department, but I’m not sure if that’s realistic with my schedule or if it’ll even help. Do you think that’s worth a shot, or should I be looking somewhere else for that kind of support?\ntherapist: You're absolutely right that starting to build new supportive connections can feel daunting, especially when you're already juggling so much. Reaching out to old undergrad friends or seeking a mentor outside your department could be great options, but it might also help to consider smaller, more manageable steps—like joining a professional group or online community related to your field, or even setting aside time each week to engage with inspiring stories or podcasts about people making an impact in your area of interest. Sometimes, even a little bit of positivity and connection can go a long way in protecting your headspace and keeping you grounded in your bigger picture goals.\nclient: Thanks for the suggestions—starting small with something like a professional group or even just listening to inspiring podcasts feels a bit more doable right now. I’m just kinda worried that I’ll still feel isolated if it’s mostly online or not directly tied to my day-to-day environment, you know?\n\nI mean, I’m willing to give it a shot, but I guess I’m craving something more personal, like actual conversations with people who get what I’m going through or who can push me to stay on track. Do you think there’s a way to find that kind of connection without it turning into another draining obligation?\ntherapist: It's great that you're open to trying smaller steps, and I can see how face-to-face connections might feel more meaningful. Have you thought about exploring professional networking events or local meetups in your field? These could offer opportunities for in-person conversations with people who share similar experiences or goals.\nclient: Yeah, I hadn’t really considered local meetups or networking events, and I can see how those might give me a chance to connect with people in a more real way. I’m just a bit nervous about stepping into those spaces when I’m already feeling kinda off my game—do you have any tips for how to approach them without it feeling like I’m forcing myself or coming off as desperate for help?\ntherapist: It’s understandable to feel apprehensive, but remember that these events are designed to bring people together—most folks there are likely feeling similarly uncertain. One approach could be to set a small, achievable goal for yourself, like striking up a conversation with just one person or staying for a specific amount of time. That way, you’re easing into it without overwhelming yourself, and you can always adjust as you go.\nclient: Thanks for the tip—I like the idea of setting a small goal like talking to just one person or sticking around for a short time. It makes the whole thing feel less intimidating, you know?\n\nI guess I’m still a bit worried about how to even start that conversation without sounding like I’m just there to vent or fish for advice. Like, I don’t want to come across as needy or out of place—any ideas on how to break the ice in a way that feels natural?\ntherapist: Sure, I get that concern. How about asking someone about their experience with a project or topic related to the meetup? Something like, \"\"What drew you to this field?\"\" or \"\"I’m curious, what’s one thing you’ve learned recently that’s stuck with you?\"\" These kinds of questions can spark meaningful conversations without coming across as desperate or out of place.\nclient: Thanks, those are solid ideas for starting a convo without feeling like I’m oversharing or coming off weird. I can see myself asking something like that and just seeing where it goes.\n\nI’m still kinda stuck on the thought of whether these interactions will actually help me feel less alone in all this grad school mess. Like, what if I meet people, but it’s just surface-level stuff and I’m still left feeling disconnected—do you have any thoughts on how to build something deeper from those initial chats?\ntherapist: Sure, that's a valid concern. One idea could be to look for common ground or shared experiences during those initial conversations, and then follow up with a more personal question or comment that invites further discussion. For example, if someone mentions a challenge they've faced, you could say something like, \"\"That sounds tough—how did you manage to navigate that situation?\"\" or \"\"I’ve experienced something similar, it’s helpful to know I’m not the only one.\"\"\nRemember, building deeper connections often takes time, so it's okay if it doesn't happen right away. You could also try staying in touch with people you connect with, even if it's just a quick message or coffee meetup, to see if a deeper relationship can develop naturally.\nclient: Got it, I like the idea of finding some common ground and following up with something a bit more personal to dig deeper. It’s reassuring to hear that it’s okay if it takes time—I guess I’ve been putting a lot of pressure on myself to fix this disconnection fast.\n\nI’m just wondering, though, how do I keep myself from getting discouraged if those follow-ups don’t pan out, you know? Like, if I reach out for a coffee or send a message and it just fizzles out or they don’t seem interested, how do I not let that knock me back even further?\ntherapist: That’s a really important question, and it’s understandable to worry about feeling discouraged if things don’t go as planned. One way to approach this might be to focus on the act of reaching out itself as a success, regardless of the outcome. For example, you could think of it as practicing courage and openness, which are valuable in their own right, even if the connection doesn’t deepen right away. It’s also helpful to remember that people’s responses often have more to do with their own circumstances than with you personally, so it’s not necessarily a reflection of your worth or likability.\nclient: Thanks for saying that—it helps to think of just reaching out as a win, even if it doesn’t lead to anything. I guess I’ve been so focused on the end result that I forget the value in just trying.\n\nI’m still kinda worried, though, about how to keep pushing myself to do this when I’m already feeling so drained by the grad school environment. Like, where do I find the energy to keep putting myself out there when everything else feels so heavy?\nclient: I appreciate you bringing that up—it’s real to feel drained with everything grad school throws at you. I’m just wondering if there’s a way to balance taking small steps to connect with also giving myself some space to recharge, you know?\nclient: Thanks for the insight—I like the idea of balancing small steps with some downtime to recharge. Do you have any tips on how I can set boundaries or pace myself so I don’t burn out while still trying to build these connections?\nclient: I’m glad you’re thinking about pacing yourself—it’s definitely important with everything on my plate. I’d love to hear any specific ideas you have on setting those boundaries without feeling like I’m shutting people out completely.\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate you diving into this with me. I’m curious if you have any practical ways I can set those boundaries while still keeping the door open for connections, especially when I’m already stretched thin.\nclient: Thanks for the suggestions—I think having some concrete ways to set boundaries will really help me manage everything. I’m just wondering how I can start small with this, especially when I’m already feeling overwhelmed by deadlines and stuff.\nclient: Thanks for the ideas—I’m definitely going to try starting small with those boundary-setting strategies. Do you think focusing on just one or two things at a time could help me ease into it without adding more stress?\nclient: Thanks for that perspective—I think focusing on just one or two things at a time could really work for me. I’m just a bit worried about keeping up with it all, so do you have any thoughts on how I can stay consistent without feeling like it’s another big task?",
