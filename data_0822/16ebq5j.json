I hoped to work with them in the future and worked more in their subjects where I had the best grades.\n\nThese persons are now less rude against me but I feel so bad about this, I am so deeply hurt and I can't focus on my lectures with them anymore without thinking about what happened.\n\nThese persons are the one who gave me interest in the degree I'm pursuing and I'm not even feeling good about my own degree anymore, I'me even doubting my career.\n\nI am old for my cohort as I had a lot of issues in the past with my disability and health and these people are the one who gave me a second chance and now it went like this. I don't think I can change to another degree or start over. But it hurts me to continue. I have only these persons in lectures now, and I feel bad spending 20h a week with them and working on their things and so on.\n\nI'm absolutely lost, I don't know what to do. I fear reaching out, I fear telling them how I feel about what happened, I feel like giving up.",

But I’m still worried it’ll feel like I’m throwing away all the hard work I’ve put in, you know?\ntherapist: Your concern about the hard work you've put in is completely valid, and it shows how much this degree means to you. What if pausing could actually help you come back to it with more clarity and strength, rather than feeling like you're losing ground?\nclient: I get that, and the idea of coming back stronger sounds nice, but I just can’t shake the fear that I’ll lose momentum or get stuck in that pause forever. It’s like, I’ve fought so hard to even be here, and stopping feels like I’m risking everything I’ve pushed for.\ntherapist: That fear of losing momentum and risking everything you've worked for is really powerful, and it makes sense that you'd feel that way after everything you've been through. What if we reframe the idea of pausing not as a risk, but as a strategic move to protect your investment in yourself and your future?\nclient: Honestly, that makes sense on some level, reframing it as protecting what I’ve built, but I still feel this knot in my stomach about stepping back. Like, what if I lose my place or can’t get back into the groove, you know?\ntherapist: It's completely understandable that you'd feel that knot in your stomach, given the hard-won progress you've made. What if we explore how pausing might actually help you preserve your place, rather than risking it?\nclient: Yeah, I hear you on exploring how a pause could help me hold onto what I’ve got, and I’m open to thinking about it. It’s just, there’s still this nagging worry in my head that I’ll fall behind or mess up everything I’ve fought for if I step away even for a bit.\ntherapist: Your worries about falling behind or messing things up are totally valid, especially after all you've fought for. What if we reframe the pause as a way to create space for a fresh perspective, so you can come back even more focused and determined?\nclient: I get what you’re saying about a pause giving me space for a fresh perspective, and part of me wants to believe it could help me come back stronger. But I’m still stuck on this fear that taking a break might just make me feel more disconnected or lost, you know?\ntherapist: It’s understandable that the fear of feeling disconnected or lost is still lingering, especially when you’ve worked so hard to get to where you are. What if we also think about the pause as a chance to reconnect with yourself, rather than losing your footing?\nclient: Yeah, I can see how a pause might be a chance to reconnect with myself, and that sounds kinda nice in theory. But I’m just so scared that stepping away, even with good intentions, might make it harder to face everything when I come back, you know?\ntherapist: It's natural to feel scared about stepping away, especially when you've worked so hard to face everything. What if we reframe this fear as a sign of how much you care about your progress, and use that care to guide your decision?\nclient: Yeah, I get that my fear shows how much I care about what I’ve built so far, and that’s a helpful way to look at it. I’m just still torn because I don’t want to lose momentum, but I also don’t know how to keep pushing through when I feel this stuck.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're caught between two powerful feelings: the desire to protect the progress you've made, and the need to give yourself space to recharge. What if we explore ways to pause that still allow you to hold onto your momentum, even if it's just a little?\nclient: Yeah, I think exploring ways to pause without totally losing my momentum could be a good middle ground. I’m just not sure what that would even look like, you know, like how do I step back but still keep some kind of connection to what I’m working on?\ntherapist: You've already mentioned a few strategies that could help you pause without losing momentum, like setting aside a specific time each day to reflect on your progress or using a journal to keep track of your thoughts and feelings. What if we also consider other options, like creating a small ritual to mark the beginning and end of your pause, or setting a gentle reminder for yourself to revisit your goals when you're ready?\nclient: Yeah, I like the idea of a small ritual or something to kinda frame the pause, make it feel intentional instead of just drifting away. I’m curious, though, how do I even pick what that ritual could be, or make sure a reminder doesn’t just stress me out more?\ntherapist: You're already thinking through this in such a thoughtful way, which is a great sign. Maybe the ritual could be something simple and meaningful to you, like lighting a candle or going for a short walk. As for the reminder, it could be as gentle as a weekly check-in with yourself, where you reflect on how you're feeling and whether you're ready to move forward. What feels most soothing or energizing to you when you imagine these possibilities?\nclient: Honestly, I think a short walk could be kinda nice, like just stepping outside for a bit to clear my head and mark that pause. Something about fresh air feels calming, and I guess I’m wondering if I could tie that to reflecting on how I’m doing without it turning into overthinking.",
