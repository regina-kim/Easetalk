  "concern": "Hello redditors,\nIn December I got fired from my PhD in Biochemistry, not even after 1 year into it. \n\nI had a very rough year. I came from a very different background and I struggled a bit to adjust at the beginning. After some time from the start, my dad got very sick and I missed almost a month of work to stay with him. He passed away eventually. \nI fell into my deepest depressive episode and I was not the most productive. When I touched the bottom, I managed to get up and I worked myself to death to compensate but in the end, for my supervisor was not enough.\n\nHe decided to let me go, he gave me two months of extension to organize and we agreed on what he wanted me to finish. Now I'm in the last two weeks and I have absolutely no motivation to do anything, not even to go there. I finished what I had to do, I am slowly doing another project but I am not really producing much. I just want to prioritize the search of another job, leave everything behind and start again.\n\nI still feel judged for not doing enough. Am I behaving badly? What should I do in this final period?\nThanks!",
