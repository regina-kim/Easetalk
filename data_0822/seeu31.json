  "concern": "I'm in a MA program right now and we just started in-person learning. Until this week, I had been at my parents' house doing online school from there. While I'm definitely not the biggest proponent of online school, I was actually really enjoying life at home. I got to focus on doing readings and work without worrying about maintaining my own living space, I didn't have a commute to and from classes, and I really enjoyed hanging out with my family every day. Now I'm in a different city which is still pretty shut down from the pandemic, living alone, I can't see anyone, I haven't been able to focus on my coursework that much, and I just feel really *lonely* especially since the people in my cohort aren't keen on getting together due to the pandemic. Even though I absolutely love my program and what I'm studying, I'm starting to question if it's worth the lifestyle choices that are necessary (e.g., moving away from home, the job search being global rather than local). Now, I'm finding myself wishing the weeks would pass until I can go back during the break. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way and how they cope with it. I'm also wondering if moving away for grad school is that much better if there weren't a pandemic shutting everything down/limiting any social activities; especially since so many people refer to grad school as an isolating experience anyway.",

It's natural to wonder if things would feel different under more normal circumstances, and I'm here to help you explore these feelings and figure out what might help you feel more connected and grounded.\nclient: Thanks for understanding where I’m coming from. I just feel so torn, you know, because I don’t want to give up on something I’m passionate about, but at the same time, I’m struggling to find a balance with feeling so alone all the time. Like, I keep asking myself if there’s a way to make this work without feeling like I’m sacrificing so much of my happiness. What do you think—how can I start to feel more okay with being here, or at least less overwhelmed by it all?\ntherapist: It's clear that your passion for your studies is an important part of your life, and it's understandable that you're hesitant to give up on something that means so much to you. At the same time, it's important to prioritize your happiness and well-being, especially during this challenging transition. I'm here to help you explore ways to find a balance that works for you and to identify steps you can take to feel more connected and grounded in your new environment.\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate that perspective. I want to make this work, but I’m just not sure where to start with finding that balance.\n\nUgh, I don’t know, I guess I’m just feeling stuck. Like, I try to focus on my readings or assignments, but my mind keeps wandering to how much I miss being at home with my family, or even just having someone to chat with casually. I’ve thought about reaching out to people in my cohort more, but everyone seems so cautious about meeting up, and I get it, but it just adds to the loneliness. Do you have any ideas on how I can maybe build some kind of connection here, even if it’s small, without pushing past people’s comfort zones? And honestly, I’m still wondering if this whole grad school thing is supposed to feel this hard, or if I’m just not cut out for being so far away.\ntherapist: You're not alone in feeling this way, and it's important to remember that your desire for connection and balance is completely valid. Let's explore some small steps you could take to build connections in your new environment, while respecting the boundaries of those around you. Perhaps starting with virtual meetups or online study groups could be a gentle way to begin forming connections. What do you think?\nclient: Thanks for suggesting that. I think virtual meetups or online study groups could be a good starting point, especially since people seem more comfortable with that right now. I guess I’ve been hesitant to even try that because I’m worried it won’t feel like enough, you know, like it won’t really fill that gap of missing real, in-person connection. But maybe it’s better than nothing. Have you seen other students make that work, or do you have any tips on how to make those online interactions feel a bit more meaningful? And I’m still kinda wrestling with whether this level of struggle is just part of grad school or if I’m making it harder on myself by being so far from home.\ntherapist: It's great that you're considering virtual options as a starting point. Many students have found success in building meaningful connections through online platforms, even if it doesn't replicate the full experience of in-person interaction. One tip might be to try video calls instead of just text-based communication, as seeing someone's face can add a bit of warmth and closeness. As for the struggle of grad school, it's normal to feel overwhelmed, but your distance from home could definitely be amplifying those feelings. It might be helpful to reflect on what aspects of grad school you're enjoying and which ones feel particularly challenging right now.\nclient: Thanks for the suggestion about video calls; I think seeing people’s faces could definitely make a difference, even if it’s not the same as being there in person. I’ll try to set up something small, like a casual chat or study session over Zoom, and see how it feels.\n\nHonestly, I do love parts of grad school—like diving into the material and the discussions when they happen—but the isolation and being so far from my support system are just weighing on me a ton. I keep wondering if I’d feel this way even without the pandemic, or if it’s just the circumstances making everything harder. Do you think it’s possible to figure out if this is just a temporary rough patch, or if maybe grad school away from home isn’t the right fit for me long-term? I don’t want to make a rash decision, but I also don’t want to keep pushing through if it’s not sustainable, you know?\ntherapist: It's understandable to question whether this is a temporary challenge or a sign that grad school away from home might not be the right fit for you long-term. One way to approach this could be to set a specific time frame, say a few months, to focus on implementing the small steps we've discussed—like virtual meetups and prioritizing the aspects of grad school you enjoy—while also keeping a journal to track how you feel over time. This could help you gain clarity on whether the difficulties you're facing are situational or more deeply rooted.\nclient: Thanks for that idea. Setting a time frame and journaling my feelings sounds like a practical way to figure out what’s really going on with me, without jumping to any quick conclusions.\n\nI guess I’m just still kinda nervous about whether I’ll be able to tell the difference between a rough patch and something bigger, you know? Like, what if I keep feeling this way even after trying these steps? Do you think there are specific things I should look out for in my journaling to help me see if this is just temporary or if I need to rethink my whole plan? And honestly, I’m still worried that even if I make some connections here, it won’t be enough to make up for being so far from my family.\ntherapist: You’re raising some important questions, and it’s great that you’re thinking through this so carefully. When journaling, you might want to pay attention to patterns—like whether there are specific situations or times when your feelings of isolation or frustration feel more manageable, or whether there are particular moments where you feel more connected. Also, noticing how you feel after taking those small steps, like setting up virtual meetups, could give you some clues about whether those efforts are helping. And about being far from family, it might be helpful to reflect on what aspects of their support you’re missing most—whether it’s emotional, practical, or something else—and see if there are ways to replicate or adapt that support here, even if it’s not the same.\nclient: Thanks for breaking it down like that. I think focusing on specific patterns and how I feel after trying stuff like virtual meetups could really help me get a clearer picture.\n\nHonestly, I’m still kinda stuck on this whole family thing, you know? Like, I miss just having them around for the little stuff—eating dinner together, chatting about random things, just feeling like I’m not so on my own. I’m not sure if there’s a way to recreate that here, especially with everything still so locked down. Do you think there’s anything I can do to kinda bridge that gap, even just a little, while I’m so far away? And I guess I’m also wondering if this feeling of missing them so much is gonna stick with me no matter what, or if it might get easier over time.\nclient: Thanks for the suggestions on journaling and reflecting on what I’m missing most from family. I’ll definitely try to pinpoint those specific things and see if I can find small ways to fill that gap.\n\nI’m just still feeling pretty unsure about whether this longing for home will ever really fade, you know? Like, I want to make this work, but it’s hard to imagine feeling settled when I’m missing those everyday moments with my family so much. Do you think there’s a way to balance staying connected with them while still building something meaningful here, even if it feels so different? I guess I’m just trying to figure out how to not feel so split between two worlds all the time.\nclient: Thanks for the ideas on balancing things. I’ll try to think about ways to stay connected with my family while also building something here, even if it feels tricky right now.\n\nI guess I’m just still worried about feeling so torn, you know? Like, I want to commit to this grad school journey, but my heart’s kinda half at home. Do you have any thoughts on how I can start to feel more whole, or at least less pulled in two directions, while I’m figuring this out?\nclient: Thanks for the input. I’m glad to have some ideas to work with on staying connected and building something here.\n\nI’m still feeling pretty split, though, you know? Like, I want to dive into this grad school thing, but part of me is always thinking about home. Do you have any tips on how I can start feeling a bit more grounded here, even with that pull still there?\nclient: Thanks for the advice. I’ll definitely give those ideas a shot to help me feel more settled.\n\nI guess I’m just still wondering how long it might take to feel like I really belong here, you know? Like, is there anything else I can do to make this place start feeling a bit more like home while I’m working through these feelings?\nclient: Thanks for the guidance. I’ll keep working on those suggestions to help me feel more at ease here.\n\nI’m still kinda curious, though, about how others in similar situations have handled this, you know? Like, do you have any general insights or stories about how people far from home eventually find their footing, even if it takes time?\nclient: Thanks for sharing that curiosity. I’m glad you’re open to hearing about how others have navigated this, and I’ll definitely think about some examples or insights that might resonate with you.\n\nBefore we wrap up, I just want to check in—do you feel like we’ve covered the main things on your mind today, or is there anything else you’d like to touch on briefly?\nclient: Thanks for checking in. I think we’ve hit the main stuff I was wrestling with today, but I appreciate the space to talk it out—maybe next time we can dive a bit deeper into some of those examples if I’m still feeling stuck.\nclient: No problem, I’m glad we could cover what’s been on your mind. I’m definitely up for exploring those examples more next time if you’re still feeling stuck.\nclient: Cool, I’m looking forward to digging into that next time. Thanks again for today—it’s been really helpful to get this off my chest.\nclient: No worries, I’m glad today felt helpful. I’ll see you next time, and we’ll pick up where we left off.\nclient: Sounds good, I appreciate you making time for me. I’ll see you next time and we’ll keep the conversation going.\nclient: Thanks, I’m really glad we had this chance to talk. I’ll catch you at our next session!\nclient: Thanks, I’m glad we got to talk today too. I’ll see you at our next session!",
