  "concern": "I’m in a History MA program (graduating in May!) and it’s been a big struggle but the worst part is the complete lack of standard expectations.\n\nOver the summer (2021) all of my cohort had to do an internship. At the end of the internship we had to write a reflection essay about our experiences. However, this essay is reviewed by our advisor and depending on what they want the essays are very different. Most were 4-5 pages with a lot of self-reflection, one or two people got away with 1-2 pages. \n\nBut my advisor (who only has me as an advisee as they are on sabbatical) asked for a ten page paper which they have  returned FOUR  times for more editing. This most recent return they are asking me to add at least four paragraphs were I explain some books related to the internship topic, what their main points were, and how I felt those were reflected in my internship. No one else in my cohort was asked to do this but since I need advisor approval I am stuck adding all their demands. I’m the last one still working on this essay.\n\nAlso it needs to be submitted before the 21st so I can graduate so on top of finishing my capstone, regular work for class, and helping a sick family member, I have to work on this stupid essay. My advisor is completely aware of all of this too. And since they are on sabbatical it can be up to a month before I get a response. I’m just so frustrated!!!!",
