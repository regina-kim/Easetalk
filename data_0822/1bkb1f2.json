  "concern": "I have severe anxiety and type 2 bipolar disorder. I went into a depressive spiral four days ago, i.e. one week before the scholarship deadline. I literally just summoned the wherewithal to open my laptop again. Therefore, the application is going to be submitted super short notice - the deadline is Monday, the 25th. I didn't even realize that four days had passed and it is already Friday.\n\nMy PI is extremely supportive and understanding, but he's also strict. He's not going to be happy about me approaching him on a Friday about an application due Monday, even if anxiety is my reason (he is aware of my BPD). It's a small application (, and he is not required to submit a recommendation letter or anything. I still want to try applying because it is a HUGE amount of money, but I have shot myself in the foot big time and I know I'd be making an outrageous demand if I even can finish my application in time.\n\nSo how big a deal is it if I apply without consulting him? I've applied for this scholarship last year. Last year I approached him in time, but he just asked me to go ahead and apply - he did not ask me to run the research plan by him.\n\nIt's very unlikely that I will get the scholarship, since I was unable to perform well during my masters course (I have ZERO publications or conference posters). But on the off chance that I get it, he's going to be pissed that I applied without running the research plan by him.\n\nSo my question is, which is the lesser of two evils? A PI angry at my outrageous irresponsible request, or a PI angry at me applying for a scholarship without getting the research plan approved by him?\n\nP.S. It's a scholarship with research funding in addition to living expenses",
