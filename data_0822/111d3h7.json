  "concern": "I've been struggling most of my life with pretty bad depression, and things only started to get better after my first year in college. But now I've fallen back into it, very deeply. I don't know how much to share but for an idea of how bad it's gotten, I have been skipping a lot of my classes and not doing any of my assignments, nor caring enough to do anything about it. I have suicidal thoughts, and I'm trying to get onto antidepressants but it's difficult to get diagnosis and seek medical help due to conflict with my parents and school. I've also been trying to get diagnosed with ADHD, which I've been pretty sure I have for a long time now, but that has been difficult too. I have a therapist I see twice a week, which has been helpful sometimes, but I think I need more.\n\nI don't think I can keep going like this. my last semester I got all A's, so to outsiders it seems like I'm doing fine, but man, I'm an art student. Grades barely matter, and those A's are more indicative of how generous and understanding my professors were; in reality I barely attended class, finished less than half of my projects the whole semester, and dropped classes to go part-time, hoping it would help, but it wasn't enough. \n\nMy parents and my therapist have basically told me different versions of \"just power through it\", but I can't. Especially because all of my assignments are art. It's not a set start or finish, a list of questions to answer, or busywork. It's always personal and being creative is really hard for me right now, almost impossible. My parents are also scared that if I take a leave of absence and get a job or something, I'll be stuck doing that forever and never go back to school. The only person that has suggested that a leave might be a good idea was my advisor. \n\nBut I know a lot of people deal with depression in college, and they still carry on. Am I just being lazy, or giving up too easily? Just making an excuse to do nothing? I want to spend the time off seeking more active mental help, but is that enough reason? I don't know anymore.",

Like, could it actually help, or am I just running from my problems?\ntherapist: I can see how torn you feel about this decision, and it’s understandable that you're worried about the potential consequences. It's possible that taking a break could give you the space you need to focus on your mental health, but it's also valid to be concerned about the possibility of not returning to school. Perhaps we could explore what it would look like to take a leave of absence, and what steps you could take to ensure that you do return to school when you're ready?\nclient: Thanks for being open to exploring this with me. I guess I’m just nervous about how to even structure a break—would I just be sitting around feeling worse, or could I actually use the time to get better with more intensive help or something? Like, I want to make sure it’s not just me avoiding stuff, you know? What kind of steps could we think about to make sure I’d come back to school after a leave?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're really trying to be thoughtful about this decision, which is great. Taking a break doesn't have to mean just sitting around—could you imagine using the time to focus on your mental health, maybe even with more intensive support? And as for coming back to school, maybe we could brainstorm some ideas, like setting a date to revisit the decision or creating a plan to gradually return to classes?\nclient: Thanks for helping me think this through. I like the idea of setting a date to check in on coming back—it makes it feel less like I’m just walking away forever. I’m still kinda worried about what “more intensive support” would even look like, though. Like, I’m already seeing you twice a week, but I don’t know if there’s something more out there that could help me get out of this hole faster. Do you have any thoughts on what kind of extra help I could look into during a break?\ntherapist: It's great that you're considering ways to use a break productively, and I appreciate your openness to exploring options. More intensive support could mean anything from daily therapy sessions, to inpatient treatment programs, or even online resources and support groups. The key is to find something that works for you and your needs. What do you think might be most helpful for you during this time?\nclient: I'm glad you're helping me think through what could work, 'cause I’m honestly not sure what I need beyond what we’re already doing. I guess something more structured or frequent sounds interesting, but I’m kinda overwhelmed just thinking about inpatient stuff or finding the right groups—do you think we could narrow it down together based on what’s realistic for me right now?\ntherapist: Absolutely, let’s work together to figure out what’s realistic and manageable for you. Perhaps we could start by considering what your current schedule and energy levels would allow, and then explore options that align with those constraints? For instance, if daily therapy sessions seem too intense, we could look into partial hospitalization programs that offer structure without requiring a full-time commitment. Or if inpatient treatment feels overwhelming, maybe online resources and support groups could provide the additional support you're looking for without being too demanding. We can take it step by step, and I’m here to help you navigate the options.\nclient: Thanks for being willing to break this down with me—I really appreciate the guidance. I think starting with something that fits my energy levels is a good idea, ‘cause I’m barely getting through the day as it is. Like, partial hospitalization sounds kinda intense still, but maybe online resources or a support group could be a starting point without feeling like too much. Can we talk more about what those online options or groups might look like, and how I’d even find ones that aren’t just a waste of time?\ntherapist: It's great that you're thinking about what would work best for your current situation. Online resources and support groups can be a great starting point, offering flexibility and structure. Some popular options include online therapy platforms like BetterHelp or Talkspace, which offer video sessions with licensed therapists, and support groups like 7 Cups or Reddit communities. We can also look into local resources that might be a good fit for you, and I can help you evaluate which ones might be most beneficial based on your needs.\nclient: Thanks for pointing me toward those options—I’m definitely curious about how they could fit into my life. I’ve heard of BetterHelp and stuff like that, but I’m kinda worried about whether they’re legit or if I’ll just end up feeling more lost trying to figure them out; can you help me sort through what’s actually worth trying and how to get started with something like that?\ntherapist: Absolutely, let’s start by exploring what aspects of these online resources are most important to you—like accessibility, affordability, or specific areas of support—so we can focus on options that align with your priorities. We can also discuss how to evaluate their credibility and user experience, and I can guide you through the process of getting started with any platform you're interested in. What would you like to focus on first?\nclient: Cool, I’m glad we’re digging into this together. Honestly, I think affordability and just finding something that doesn’t feel like a huge commitment are my main concerns right now—maybe we can start by looking at what’s cheapest or even free, and go from there?\ntherapist: Sure, let's focus on free and low-cost options first. We can explore free online support groups like 7 Cups or Reddit communities, as well as free or sliding scale therapy platforms like Open Path Collective or local community clinics. Additionally, we can look into free resources like self-help books, podcasts, or guided meditation apps. I'm here to help you evaluate which options best fit your needs and preferences.\nclient: client: Thanks for narrowing it down to those free or low-cost options—that really helps take some of the pressure off. I’m kinda curious about 7 Cups or even some of those podcasts; can we talk about how they work and if they’ve actually helped people in situations like mine, or if they’re just kinda fluff?\nclient: Thanks for breaking it down like that—I appreciate knowing there are options that won’t break the bank. I’m a bit skeptical about whether something free can really make a difference, so I’d love to hear more about how 7 Cups works and if it’s actually been useful for people dealing with stuff similar to what I’m going through.\nclient: Thanks for diving into this with me—I’m relieved to know there are affordable ways to get support. Could you tell me a bit more about how 7 Cups operates, like the setup and if it’s private, and maybe share any feedback you’ve heard about its impact?\nclient: Thanks for the suggestions—I’m glad to have some starting points that won’t stress my budget. Can we dive a bit deeper into how 7 Cups ensures privacy, and maybe talk about any real experiences or reviews you’ve come across from people who’ve used it?\nclient: Thanks, I’m really glad we’re exploring these options together, and I appreciate the focus on keeping things affordable. Could you also tell me if there’s a way to test out something like 7 Cups without feeling locked in, just to see if it vibes with me?\nclient: Thanks for the input—I’m feeling a bit more hopeful knowing there are ways to try things out without a big commitment. I’d also like to know if there’s any kind of guidance or structure in a platform like that, or if it’s more of a free-for-all kind of deal?\nclient: Thanks for walking me through all of this—it’s reassuring to have these ideas to explore. I’m still a little unsure about jumping into something new, so I’d appreciate any last thoughts or tips on getting started with a platform like 7 Cups.\nclient: Thanks for the insights—I’m feeling a bit more at ease with the idea of trying something like 7 Cups. Do you have any quick advice on how to approach it for the first time so I don’t feel totally out of my depth?\nclient: Thanks for the advice—I’m feeling a bit more confident about giving it a try. Do you think it’s okay to just start small and see how it feels before really diving in?\nclient: Thanks for the reassurance—I’m glad to hear it’s fine to take it slow. I think starting small makes sense for me right now, just to get a feel for things without too much pressure.\nclient: Thanks for that—I’m really relieved to know I can ease into it at my own pace. I guess I’m just curious if there’s anything else I should keep in mind before we wrap up today?",
