But i searched a bit about computer science, it courses from what my future uni offers, asked for advice around, listened to people from yt IN cs and its jobs prospects, plus i started to like the field but have no experience in coding, so thats what i chose… \n   Did i make a good choice?\n\n\n(I have good grades)\n(I wont say i have practice in every maths courses cs offers but i like maths so thats that thing out of the way)\n(Also please advice if I wont lose job opportunities as a Women in cs)",
