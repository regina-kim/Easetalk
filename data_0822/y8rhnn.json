  "concern": "Hi y'all. I (f22) am graduating next semester and I can't tell you how I regret every bit of it. The friends I made, the parties I went to, my poor mental health. It destroyed my trajectory. I can put some of the blame on the pandemic. After covid hit, I decided to take a semester off. I lost all my passion, didn't know what job I wanted, and was distracted by boys and friends and freedom. I didn't know I had undiagnosed depression and ADHD. I went back to school, but to a community college. Waste of time, all those classes meant nothing at a 4 year university. Refused to go back to my original school and went somewhere an hour away. I said it was for the instate tuition. I was really just scared of returning to a place I felt so depressed and lost when I was 18. When I finally returned to my original university, the one that actually had the best opportunities, I had wasted all that time. If I want to graduate on time, and I do, I can't indulge in all the opportunities.\n\nI messed up my academics, my friends, my health (mental and physical). Use me as an example and set school as a priority. Its something everyone tells you and everyone brushes it off. Well, surprise surprise. Should've listened.\n\nAny similar thoughts or feelings; whether it's over devotion to school or missed chances? Regret this large is new to me.",

It’s like I was so caught up in everything else that I didn’t focus on what really mattered.\n\nI guess I’m just stuck on how I could’ve done things differently, and it’s eating at me. Like, I see other people my age who seem to have it all together, and I’m just… not there. Does that make sense? I don’t even know where to start fixing this mess.\ntherapist: I can hear how much this weighs on you, and it's completely understandable to feel that way. You're not alone in this struggle, and we can start by exploring what you hope to achieve, and then work on building a plan together.\nclient: Thanks, that means a lot to hear. I guess I just wanna get to a place where I feel like I’m moving forward, not stuck in this regret loop, ya know? Like, I wanna figure out how to make the most of what’s left of my time in school and beyond, but I’m kinda clueless on how to even start setting those goals or whatever. Where do we even begin with something like that?\ntherapist: I understand your desire to move forward and make the most of your time. We can start by exploring your strengths, values, and aspirations, and work from there to identify goals that align with who you are and what you want to achieve.\nclient: Cool, that sounds like a solid way to go. I’m just not super sure what my strengths even are right now, or like, what I really wanna do, so I hope we can figure that out together. Where do we start with digging into that stuff? I’m kinda all over the place, but I’m ready to try.\ntherapist: We can begin by reflecting on your past experiences and accomplishments, identifying moments when you felt most fulfilled or proud of yourself. This will help us uncover your strengths and values. It might also be helpful to think about the kind of person you aspire to be, and the things that bring you joy and fulfillment. Let's take this one step at a time, and work together to create a clearer picture of your aspirations and strengths.\nclient: Hey, that sounds like a good plan to me. I’m down to take it slow and figure out what’s been meaningful to me, even if it’s hard to see right now with all the mess in my head.\n\nSo, like, when you say reflecting on past experiences, do you mean stuff from school or just life in general? I’ve got some things I’m kinda proud of, but I’m not sure if they’re even relevant to where I wanna go. And honestly, I’m a little scared to dig too deep ‘cause I feel like I’ll just get stuck on the bad stuff again. How do we make sure I don’t spiral back into that regret thing while we’re doing this?\ntherapist: That's a great question. When I say reflecting on past experiences, I mean both school and life in general. Any experience that has left an impact on you, whether positive or challenging, can provide valuable insights into your strengths and values. It's natural to feel apprehensive about revisiting past regrets, but we can work together to ensure that we focus on what you've learned from those experiences rather than getting stuck on the negative emotions. We can also take breaks or shift the focus if you start to feel overwhelmed, so you're always in control of the process.\nclient: Thanks for explaining that. I like the idea of focusing on what I’ve learned instead of just the bad feelings, and knowing we can take breaks if it gets too heavy really helps.\n\nSo, I guess I’m ready to start thinking about some of those moments. Like, I remember feeling pretty good when I helped organize a small fundraiser for a club in high school, and I felt proud of pulling it together even though I was super shy back then. But I’m not sure how that connects to anything now, ya know? How do we take something like that and figure out if it’s a strength or just a random thing I did once?\ntherapist: That's a great example to start with! Let's unpack it together. What stood out to you about that experience? What skills or qualities do you think you used when you helped organize that fundraiser? Maybe we can find some clues there.\nclient: Hey, I’m glad we’re diving into this. I think what stood out was just seeing it all come together, like, I somehow got people to show up and we raised more than I expected, which felt kinda cool. I guess I had to talk to a bunch of people, even though I was shy, and figure out how to plan stuff step by step. I’m not sure if that’s a real skill or just something I stumbled through, though. How do we tell if that’s something I’m actually good at or if it was just a fluke?\ntherapist: That's a great observation. It sounds like you used some valuable skills like communication, planning, and maybe even some leadership abilities. Let's explore that a bit further. What do you think helped you push past your shyness and connect with people for the fundraiser?\nclient: Hey, I’m glad we’re digging into this. I think what helped me push past my shyness was just knowing it was for a good cause, like, I really cared about making it happen, so I kinda forced myself to talk to people even if it felt awkward at first. I guess I also had a friend in the club who kinda hyped me up, which made it easier to step out of my comfort zone. How do we figure out if that’s something I can still tap into now, especially when I’m feeling so unsure about everything?\ntherapist: It sounds like your passion for the cause and having support from a friend really helped you step up and push past your shyness. That determination and ability to seek support are great strengths that you can still tap into now. How do you think you could use those strengths to help you move forward with the challenges you're facing today?\nclient: Hey, I’m glad we’re connecting those dots. I think maybe I could try leaning on that determination by focusing on something I care about now, like figuring out my next steps after graduation, even if it feels overwhelming. And maybe reaching out to friends or mentors for support could help me feel less stuck, like it did back then. How do I start small with that, though, without feeling like I’m just gonna mess it up again?\ntherapist: Starting small could look like identifying one specific area you care about, like researching career paths or reaching out to one friend for support. This way, you can build momentum without feeling overwhelmed. What’s one step you could take this week that aligns with your determination and desire for support?\nclient: Hey, I’m glad we’re breaking this down into manageable pieces. I think one step I could take this week is maybe sending a quick message to a friend or a mentor about grabbing coffee or just chatting about post-grad ideas, something low-pressure to get the ball rolling. How do I keep myself from overthinking it and backing out at the last second?\ntherapist: That sounds like a great first step! To avoid overthinking, you could try setting a specific time to send that message and commit to it, like scheduling a reminder on your phone. Remember, this is just a casual chat to start building momentum, and it’s okay if it feels a bit awkward at first—just like with the fundraiser, taking that initial step can help you grow more confident over time.\nclient: Hey, I appreciate the reminder to keep it casual and just take that first step. I’ll set a time on my phone to send that message so I don’t keep putting it off, and try to remind myself it’s not a big deal, just a convo. How do I deal with the nerves that pop up right before I hit send, though, ‘cause I know I’m gonna feel all jittery about it?\ntherapist: To manage those nerves, try grounding techniques like taking a few deep breaths or repeating a short, empowering phrase to yourself—like “I’ve got this” or “I’m taking a step forward.” It’s normal to feel jittery, but those feelings don’t have to stop you from moving forward. Once you hit send, you might even feel a sense of relief, just like you did after stepping up for the fundraiser.\nclient: Hey, thanks for the grounding idea. I’ll definitely try the deep breaths and maybe say “I’ve got this” to myself before I send the message, just to calm those jitters a bit. I guess I’m just worried about how they’ll respond, or if they’ll even care to chat—how do I handle it if it feels like I’m being brushed off or if it doesn’t go the way I hope?\ntherapist: Hey, I hear you—anticipating their response can be nerve-wracking, but remember, you’re reaching out for support, not for a perfect outcome. If it feels like they’re brushing you off, you could try rephrasing your message to clarify your intent, like “Hey, I’d love to grab coffee sometime to talk about post-grad ideas—I know you’re busy, but even a quick chat would mean a lot to me.” And if it doesn’t go as planned, that’s okay too.\nclient: Hey, thanks for that perspective—it’s helpful to remember I’m just reaching out for support, not expecting everything to be perfect. I’ll keep that rephrasing idea in mind if I feel like I’m not getting through, and try not to take it too personally if it doesn’t work out. I guess I’m also worried about feeling like I’m bothering them, you know? Like, what if I’m just adding to their stress or they don’t have time for me—how do I shake that feeling of being a burden when I’m trying to connect?\nclient: Hey, I’m really glad you brought that up because that feeling of being a burden can be so heavy. To ease that worry, you might remind yourself that reaching out is a normal part of building connections—most people appreciate being thought of, even if they’re busy. If it helps, you could even start the message by acknowledging their time, like saying, “Hey, I know you’ve got a lot on your plate, but I’d love to chat if you’ve got a minute.” How does that sound to you?\nclient: Hey, that sounds like a good approach—acknowledging their time upfront feels respectful and might take some of the pressure off me. I’ll give that a shot and try to keep in mind that reaching out is just a normal thing, not a burden. I guess I’m still a bit anxious about overthinking their tone or response time—any quick tips to stop myself from spiraling on that?\nclient: Hey, I’m glad you think that approach could work for you. A quick tip to avoid overthinking their tone or response time is to set a mental boundary—like deciding not to check for a reply constantly and focusing on something else you enjoy in the meantime. How do you feel about trying that to keep your mind from spinning?\nclient: Hey, that’s a solid idea—I think setting a mental boundary and distracting myself with something I enjoy could really help keep me from overanalyzing every little thing. Do you have any other quick tricks for staying grounded if I start feeling anxious about it again?",
