  "concern": "The current politics class I am in requires us to use Cengage. Thankfully the book was free(cool professor!), so we just need to buy the access code to do the homework assignments and quizzes, everything else is through our eLearning site. For some reason the 14 days grace period was locked and I am not able to access it. The access code fee is a bit expensive for me, they wont let me charge it to my financial aid either. So I have to pay out of pocket. I don't mind paying it, but this is an accelerated course, and there is not a lot of assignments on the actual Cengage part(there is like 30 and they are all multiple choice quizzes). So I can finish all the course work in a couple days(a week max). It does not at all seem worth it to pay this much for this short of a course. Would I be able to get a refund for this access code after I finish the course? ",
