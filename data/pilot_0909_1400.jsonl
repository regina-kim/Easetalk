{"id":"seeu31","timestamp":1643328000000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"I'm in a MA program right now and we just started in-person learning. Until this week, I had been at my parents' house doing online school from there. While I'm definitely not the biggest proponent of online school, I was actually really enjoying life at home. I got to focus on doing readings and work without worrying about maintaining my own living space, I didn't have a commute to and from classes, and I really enjoyed hanging out with my family every day. Now I'm in a different city which is still pretty shut down from the pandemic, living alone, I can't see anyone, I haven't been able to focus on my coursework that much, and I just feel really *lonely* especially since the people in my cohort aren't keen on getting together due to the pandemic. Even though I absolutely love my program and what I'm studying, I'm starting to question if it's worth the lifestyle choices that are necessary (e.g., moving away from home, the job search being global rather than local). Now, I'm finding myself wishing the weeks would pass until I can go back during the break. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way and how they cope with it. I'm also wondering if moving away for grad school is that much better if there weren't a pandemic shutting everything down\/limiting any social activities; especially since so many people refer to grad school as an isolating experience anyway.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hi there!

Based on what you said, some options could include scheduling specific times for these non-work activities or setting clear boundaries with work during these times. What do you think might work best for you to start with, and how can we anticipate any barriers you might encounter?\nclient: I think scheduling specific times could be a good start, like maybe blocking out an hour or two in the evenings to unwind. The main barrier I foresee is the guilt of not working during those times or my PI expecting me to be available all the time.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're considering scheduling specific time to unwind, which aligns well with your goals of self-care and work-life balance. It's understandable to feel concerned about guilt or expectations from your PI. How might you address these feelings or expectations, and what support would be helpful for you in implementing this plan?\nclient: I guess addressing those feelings might start with reminding myself that taking time for myself actually makes me more productive in the long run. As for my PI's expectations, maybe I need to have a conversation about my boundaries to see if we can find some sort of balance. Support from friends or colleagues who understand the situation would be really helpful too, I think.\ntherapist: therapist: You've identified some insightful steps, such as reminding yourself of the benefits of self-care and considering a conversation with your PI about boundaries. Based on what you've mentioned, options include scheduling your unwind time and enlisting support from friends or colleagues. How would you like to prioritize these steps, and how can we track your progress and adapt as needed?\nclient: I think starting with scheduling unwind time is a good first step, and then I'll see how I feel about the conversation with my PI. It might help to chat with friends who get what I'm going through, so I'll try to reach out to them too. Maybe I can keep a little journal to track how often I'm actually sticking to my unwind times and how I'm feeling about it. \ntherapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. You've decided to start by scheduling unwind time, and reaching out to friends for support, which is an excellent step towards maintaining your self-care and work-life balance. Keeping a journal to track your progress and feelings seems like a practical way to stay aware and make any necessary adjustments. Remember, taking time for yourself is essential, and it’s truly commendable that you’re making this commitment. For next steps, you can continue with your scheduling, reach out to your friends, and keep up with your journal entries. I'm here to support you along the way, and I look forward to hearing how it goes for you. Keep up the great work!\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate it. I'll start with the scheduling and journal and see how it goes. I'll keep you posted on how things progress.","completed":false}

Welcome to our session. Feel free to share whatever's on your mind or anything you'd like to focus on today.\nclient: Hey, thanks. So I've been really stressed about this decision to change my last name, especially since I'm about to finish my PhD and haven't published much yet. I'm just worried it might mess things up with the academic connections I've made.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're feeling stressed because you fear changing your last name might impact your academic connections and future opportunities. What about this decision feels most crucial to you right now?\nclient: client: I guess it's the timing that's stressing me out the most. With my PhD defense coming up and trying to get published, I don't want anything to complicate things or make it harder for people to recognize my work.\ntherapist: therapist: You feel that the timing of this decision is critical because you don't want to complicate upcoming milestones like your PhD defense and publication efforts. What aspects of your academic recognition are most important to you?\nclient: I think it's really important for my work to be recognized and for people to see the progress I've made. I put so much effort into building these connections and getting my name out there, and I don't want a name change to make all that harder.\ntherapist: It sounds like recognition and the progress you've made are really important to you because you've invested so much effort into building connections and establishing your academic presence. How have you navigated similar feelings or decisions in the past?\nclient: Honestly, I'm usually not great with big decisions. I tend to overthink a lot and can get stuck weighing all the pros and cons, which makes it hard to actually decide on something.\ntherapist: It seems like weighing pros and cons is a process that can feel overwhelming for you because it leads to overthinking and decision paralysis. How do you typically manage when you find yourself in these situations, or is there anything that's helped you in the past?\nclient: I usually try to talk it out with friends or family, but sometimes that just adds more opinions into the mix, which can be even more confusing. Occasionally, I write things down to try and clear my head, but it doesn't always work.\ntherapist: It sounds like talking with others and writing things down are ways you've tried to manage these situations, even though they can sometimes add to the confusion. What might it look like for you if you felt more confident and clear about making such decisions?\nclient: I think I’d feel a lot less stressed and more in control of the situation. It would be nice to just feel sure of what I want and not have this constant back and forth in my head.\ntherapist: Having that sense of control and clarity seems really important to you. On a scale from 0 to 10, how confident do you feel about finding ways to achieve that clarity and reduce stress?\nclient: I’d say maybe a 4 or 5? Like, I believe it’s possible, but I’m just not sure how to get there yet. It feels like a lot of things are up in the air, and I’m not exactly sure which direction to take.\ntherapist: It sounds like you recognize the possibility for change, even though the direction feels uncertain right now. What small steps have you thought about that could help boost your confidence even a little bit?\nclient: I guess starting with more research on the name change process and maybe talking to others who have done it would help. Also, just figuring out how to explain it to the people who know me might make it feel less daunting.\ntherapist: therapist: Those are thoughtful steps, and they show a willingness to explore this change further. What do you think might be the most helpful thing to focus on first to build that confidence?\nclient: client: Probably talking to people who’ve been through this already. Hearing about their experiences might give me a better idea of what to expect and how it affected their professional connections.\ntherapist: That sounds like a valuable way to gain insight and reassurance. How do you think connecting with others who've experienced this change could impact your sense of clarity and control?\nclient: I think it could really help me feel less alone in all this and give me a clearer picture of what to expect. Plus, it'd be nice to hear about their outcomes and maybe pick up some advice on handling the transition smoothly.\ntherapist: It seems like connecting with others can offer both reassurance and practical advice. How do you envision taking the first step in reaching out to these individuals?\nclient: I might start by posting a question in academic forums or groups where people have had similar experiences. There's also a couple of colleagues I could email to see if they've gone through anything like this.\ntherapist: It sounds like you have a couple of solid ideas for reaching out. Which option feels like the best starting point for you, posting in forums or emailing colleagues?\nclient: I think starting with the forums might be easier. It's less personal, and I can see a variety of responses and experiences that way. Then, if I feel comfortable, I can reach out to colleagues directly.\ntherapist: Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. So, starting with forums feels comfortable and manageable for you. How would you like to proceed with setting a goal or timeline for posting your question?\nclient: I guess I should set a goal to post something by the end of this week. That way, I can use the weekend to go through any responses and think about how to follow up.\ntherapist: It sounds like you've really thought this through. Setting a goal to post by the end of the week is a great, concrete step forward. It gives you time to gather your thoughts and also to approach the responses over the weekend at your own pace. I hear a lot of determination in your plan, and that's fantastic. Remember, each step you take, no matter how small, is progress. As you prepare to post, keep in mind the support and insights you'll gain from others who've been in similar situations. And when you're ready to reach out to colleagues, it's there as another layer of support. You're in control of the pace, and that's important. As a next step, perhaps noting down any thoughts or questions you want to include in your forum post might be helpful. Just know that I'm here to support you with any reflections or additional steps you might want to discuss.\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate that. I'll jot down a few ideas today, and maybe we can touch base next week to see how it went.","completed":false}
