I just retook Calc 3 last semester and got a B+, but I've heard that if you retake a class and don't get an A that can look bad for grad school admissions. Is this commonly true in anyone's experience? For reference, my major is in Physics and I have all A's and B's with a 3.824 overall GPA after the retake.\n\nEdit: Major GPA is 3.65 currently",
