  "concern": "So about a couple weeks back right around the time my spring semester of college started. I finally decided to set up my student email to see what kind of messages I got that could be important. Looking through my mail, I got this one that said honor society on it. I clicked on the email that turned out to be an honor society acceptance letter. At first I was overjoyed and showed my parents who were also proud of me. I then started to set up to join this honor society program to be met with a membership menu. I was kinda puzzled having to pay for a membership when my good grades is what got me noticed in the first place. I asked my dad about it and he said that if I had to pay for a membership then I should just do it. Now I sat there in my desk chair for about 10 minutes wondering if I should seriously spend 65 dollars on a semi annual membership when I don’t even have a job yet. But then I just thought whatever and bit the bullet and sent my 65 dollars through my debit card. \n\nThen about 3 days later my sister calls me while I’m chilling playing video games at home. She asks how college is going since she’s in the same college I am. I tell her it’s going good to which she brings up honor society. I tell her it’s cool nothing seems off so far. And that’s when she tells me that honor society is a whole scam. I say there just in silence and embarrassment. She explained to me that she got an email for students to not respond to an email from honor society. I told her that I never got an email about it to which she says that I should get a new card and figure out how to solve this problem. I agreed with her and soon hung up my phone. Running to my laptop, turning it on, and scrolling through my emails I never saw a warning to never respond to an email from honor society. \n\nMy dumbass really thought I’ve seen all the scams on the internet. But it turns out I really haven’t seen nothing yet. Now it’s been a few weeks since then and I wonder from time to time about what I should do now. Should I try to get a refund and cancel my membership because it’s obviously useless to me now. And yeah 65 dollars is a major stupidity tax and I can afford to part with it but I still feel stupid and annoyed that I let something like this happen to me. So now I’m here after searching up homie society on google. Is there anything I can do to get my money back? Or am I just screwed? Either way, thanks for reading.",
