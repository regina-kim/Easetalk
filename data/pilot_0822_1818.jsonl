How does that sound?\nclient: Hey, that sounds pretty cool, I’m definitely up for trying a simple weekly view to start with. I think a whiteboard might be less stressful for me since I can just erase and adjust stuff without it feeling permanent, ya know?\ntherapist: That’s a great choice! Using a whiteboard gives you flexibility to make changes as needed. Let's think about what steps you'd take to set it up. Maybe you could start by mapping out your week, including important tasks and deadlines, and then adjust as you go?\nclient: Hey, yeah, I’m totally into the idea of mapping out my week on a whiteboard with the key stuff like tasks and deadlines. I think starting with just the big things and tweaking it as I go could keep it from feeling too heavy, ya know?\ntherapist: That’s awesome to hear! Let's also consider how you might handle unexpected tasks or changes that pop up during the week. Perhaps you could reserve a section of the whiteboard for flexible or pending tasks, allowing you to easily move or adjust them as needed.\nclient: Hey, I like the idea of having a section for flexible stuff or unexpected tasks on the whiteboard. It’d probably help me not freak out when things change last minute, ya know?\ntherapist: To summarize, we've explored ways to help you manage your ADHD while starting your master's program, focusing on visual planning as a strategy to reduce stress. We've decided to create a simple weekly calendar on a whiteboard, mapping out key tasks, deadlines, and a flexible section for unexpected changes. This approach should help you stay organized and adaptable to any adjustments needed throughout the week. Remember, the goal is to start small and be gentle with yourself as you find what works best for you. For our next session, I encourage you to reflect on how using the whiteboard planner feels and share any insights or challenges you encounter. Keep in mind that this is a process, and it's okay to make adjustments along the way. You've got this, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.\nclient: Hey, thanks for summing everything up and for the encouragement—it really helps to know I’ve got support. I’ll definitely think about how the whiteboard thing goes and let you know next time.","completed":true}

My current GPA is 2.7, and my bad grades came from 3-4 classes that I wasn't mentally thriving in.

I'm here to listen and support you in any way I can. Feel free to share whatever is on your mind, and we'll work together to explore your thoughts and feelings.\nclient: Hey, thanks for having me. I’m just feeling really overwhelmed with my prelims and getting started on my dissertation proposal, you know?\ntherapist: I can imagine how overwhelming it must feel to juggle prelims and starting your dissertation proposal. It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now—can you tell me a bit more about what’s been on your mind?\nclient: Yeah, it’s just a lot to handle, and I feel like I’m stuck before I’ve even started. I keep second-guessing myself and don’t know how to push through this mental block.\ntherapist: It’s completely understandable to feel that way, especially when you’re trying to balance so many important things. It sounds like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself, which can make it even harder to move forward. Can you tell me more about what’s going through your mind when you feel stuck?\nclient: Honestly, it’s like I sit down to write, and my brain just freezes up with all these doubts about whether I’m even on the right track. I keep worrying I’ll mess it up before I’ve even had a chance to get going.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of self-doubt, which can definitely make it tough to take that first step. But I wonder—what would happen if you allowed yourself to write without worrying about getting it perfect right away? Maybe there's a way to quiet that inner critic and let your ideas flow, even if they're not fully formed yet.\nclient: Yeah, I get what you’re saying about just letting the ideas flow, but it’s so hard to shut off that voice in my head telling me it’s not good enough. I guess I’m scared that if I start messy, I’ll just end up with a mess I can’t fix later.\n\nMan, I don’t even know where to start sometimes—like, should I just write anything, even if it’s garbage, or try to outline first? I feel like I’m spinning my wheels here and with my advisor gone, I’ve got no one to bounce this off of.\ntherapist: That fear of starting messy and not being able to fix it later makes sense, especially when you're feeling like you're on your own without your advisor to guide you. It might help to think of this as a first draft, knowing you can refine it later. What if you gave yourself permission to write anything—even if it feels imperfect or confusing—at least to get something down on paper? Sometimes starting somewhere, even if it's not the \"\"right\"\" place, can help break the cycle of self-doubt and get those ideas flowing.\nclient: Yeah, I hear you on just getting something down, even if it’s not perfect. I guess I’ve just been so hung up on wanting it to be right from the start that I’m paralyzing myself.\n\nHonestly, I think I might try just dumping my thoughts out, like a brain dump or whatever, without worrying about structure for now. Do you think that could work, or am I just setting myself up to waste time on stuff I’ll have to redo anyway?\ntherapist: It's definitely worth trying—many people find that letting go of the pressure to be perfect right away can actually help them get more done in the long run. You could always set a timer for 10 or 15 minutes and just write whatever comes to mind without stopping or editing. You might be surprised at how much you can get down on paper, even if it doesn't feel perfect at first.\nclient: Thanks, that timer idea actually sounds kinda doable—like a small, low-stakes way to just get going without overthinking it. I’m just worried I’ll stare at the blank page for those 10 minutes and still come up with nothing, you know?\n\nI guess I’ll give it a shot, though. Maybe I can just write down random bits about my study or ideas for the proposal, even if they don’t connect yet. Do you think starting with something super small like that could still help build some momentum, or should I aim for something more specific right away?\ntherapist: Here's a summary of our session:\n**Key Goals:** Break the cycle of self-doubt, initiate the writing process, and develop a sense of momentum.\n**Action Steps:** Use the \"\"brain dump\"\" technique with a timer to write freely without pressure for perfection, and allow yourself to refine your work later.\n**Coping Strategies:** Reframe your inner critic by recognizing that imperfect drafts are a normal part of the writing process, and remember that progress is more important than perfection.\n**Next Step Support Plan:** Set aside dedicated time for your writing, and continue to practice self-compassion as you work through your preliminary work and dissertation proposal. Remember that it's okay to seek support and guidance from others when needed. Keep in mind that starting small can still help build momentum, and you can always expand or refine your ideas later. You've got this!\nclient: Thanks for summarizing everything and for the encouragement—it really helps to have this laid out. I’m feeling a bit more hopeful about tackling this writing block with those small steps in mind.\n\nHonestly, I’m still a little nervous about whether I’ll actually get anywhere, but I like the idea of just starting small and not stressing too much.

{"id":"11ro6p7","timestamp":1678838400000,"category":"academic","concern":"As much as I like my work, I really fear my periods of break.  I am a CS grad student, so all of my works are done behind a few monitors.  Every time I take a break, whether it be for lunch or for once-in-hours break, once I start taking a break, I get so absorbed into it that I cannot get out of it. Most commonly, I watch YouTube videos (streams &amp; stuff) during breaks because I don't know what else to do during the break and I find this activity the most amusing.  I have tried using a timer, but I tend to give myself extra few minutes over and over, and eventually not stopping, ugh! I also heard having a regular schedule might help, but I'm not sure how to set a regular schedule given that my work only involves research (no workout, nada) and it's difficult to get out of break in the first place.\n\nI don't know if this is common, but I am the guy who gets immersed into work very quickly and likes to continue working straight, until my day's work gets to the end. Yes, I prefer work without breaks.  However, people say it's important to take breaks, and there is also some unskippable breaks like lunch and dinner.  What is the way to have a healthy break that does not break my work momentum?\n\nNow, some may recommend working out, but I unfortunately am a \"strong\" at-home person and doesn't really like working out.  I think break should be giving me some dopamine, but workout should give me near-zero dopamine, while YouTubing gives me enticingly high amount of dopamine.

I’m just feeling really overwhelmed with everything that’s been going on lately, especially with getting let go from my PhD program and trying to figure out what’s next.\ntherapist: That sounds incredibly stressful. How are you managing with the pressure of figuring out what comes next?\nclient: I'm honestly not managing it that well. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, trying to look for a new job while wrapping up stuff at the lab, but my heart’s not in it.\ntherapist: It sounds like you’re feeling stuck and maybe even a bit lost, like you’re doing what you think you should be doing, but not really feeling connected to it. Can you tell me a bit more about what that’s like for you?\nclient: Yeah, it’s exactly like that. I just feel empty, like I’m forcing myself to do stuff when I don’t even care anymore, and I’m worried I’m letting people down even more by not putting in the effort.\ntherapist: It's understandable to feel disconnected when life takes an unexpected turn, especially one that affects your sense of purpose and identity. Your feelings of emptiness and worry about letting others down make sense, given the weight of these changes. What would it mean for you to find meaning or connection again in your work or daily life?\nclient: Honestly, I’m not even sure what that would look like right now. I guess I just want to feel like I’m moving toward something that matters to me, not just checking boxes or doing stuff out of guilt.\ntherapist: I can sense how much you yearn for a deeper connection to your work and life, and how frustrating it must feel to be stuck in this in-between phase. Can you imagine what your ideal work situation would look like, or what kind of work might reignite that sense of purpose and fulfillment?\nclient: I don’t know, I think I’d want something where I feel valued, you know, where my efforts actually mean something to someone. Maybe a job or project that lets me grow and doesn’t just feel like a grind, but right now, it’s hard to even picture that with everything so up in the air.\ntherapist: It's understandable to feel uncertain when things are up in the air, but it's clear that feeling valued and contributing to something meaningful is important to you. Can you think of any small steps or actions that might help you feel more connected to your current work or daily life, even if just a little bit?\nclient: I guess I could try focusing on tying up loose ends with the last bit of work I have, maybe just to feel like I’m leaving on a decent note. It’s hard though, ‘cause I’m so checked out, but maybe even small stuff like organizing my notes or reaching out to a colleague could help me feel a tiny bit more connected.\ntherapist: That's a thoughtful and practical approach, and even small actions like organizing your notes or connecting with a colleague can create a sense of progress and connection. How do you feel about the idea of starting with those steps?\nclient: I think it’s doable, like, starting with those little things might not be too overwhelming. I’m just worried I’ll still feel kinda empty doing it, but I guess it’s worth a shot to at least close this chapter without completely hating it.\ntherapist: Starting with these small steps sounds like a gentle way to begin closing this chapter, and it's okay if the feelings of emptiness linger for now. Remember, you're not committing to anything long-term, just experimenting with ways to feel more connected, even if just a little.

It's not about putting on a front, but rather about sharing your genuine self with others.\nclient: Thanks for saying that, it makes sense to focus on what I actually believe in about my skills. I guess I just need to remind myself that I earned this job and my degree, even if it feels weird sometimes to own it. I’m still kinda stuck on how to not overthink every word when I’m talking about my background, though. Like, how do I stop worrying so much about how I’m being perceived and just... be myself in those moments?\ntherapist: It sounds like a lot of this comes down to trust in your own abilities and a shift in focus—from how you think you're being judged to what you truly bring to the table. One approach could be to practice those key phrases in low-pressure situations, like with a friend or in front of a mirror, until they feel more like second nature. This way, when the moment comes, you can lean into your preparation without overthinking it, trusting that your words are rooted in your authentic strengths. Would that feel like a manageable step, or are there other ways you think might help you find that balance between preparation and authenticity?\nclient: Thanks for the suggestion about practicing in low-pressure settings—that does sound like something I could try without feeling too overwhelmed. I’m just wondering, though, if even with practice, I’ll still get that knot in my stomach when the real moment hits, you know? Like, what if I’ve got my lines down but still feel like a fraud inside? How do I deal with that feeling creeping up, especially when I’m already in the middle of a convo?\ntherapist: It's natural to still feel some nervousness, even with practice. Instead of trying to eliminate the feeling entirely, you might consider reframing it as a sign that you care about the outcome and are invested in sharing your genuine strengths. In those moments, remind yourself that it's okay to feel a bit uncomfortable, and trust that your preparation has equipped you with the tools to navigate the conversation authentically.\nclient: Thanks for that perspective—it’s helpful to think of the nervousness as just caring about the outcome rather than something to fight against. I guess I’ve always seen that knot in my stomach as a bad thing, but maybe it’s not entirely negative if I look at it that way. I’m still kinda curious, though, about how to handle it right in the moment when it hits, like if I’m mid-sentence and suddenly feel like I’m spiraling. Do you have any quick tricks or mental reminders I can use to ground myself without totally losing my train of thought?\ntherapist: Great question! When you feel that knot in your stomach mid-sentence, try using the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique. This involves quickly naming 5 things you see, 4 things you feel, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell, and 1 thing you taste. It may sound a bit silly, but this exercise can help you refocus your mind and prevent spiraling thoughts. Additionally, you can use a mental reminder, such as silently repeating a calming phrase like \"\"I am prepared, and I trust my abilities,\"\" to help you regain confidence in the moment.\nclient: Thanks for sharing that technique—it sounds like a practical way to pull myself back when I’m starting to spiral. I’ll definitely give the 5-4-3-2-1 thing a shot, even if it feels a bit odd at first. I’m just wondering, though, if there’s a way to practice this kind of grounding ahead of time so it feels more natural when I actually need it. Like, should I try it out in less stressful moments to get the hang of it?","completed":true}
{"id":"11qmcba","timestamp":1678665600000,"category":"emotional","concern":"Cognitive Psychology Ph.D.   \nI'm a 4th year, so you think I'd be used to this! I just have no concept of how much professors have in their discretionary. I'm about to run a study that I've gotten blessing after blessing to run. It's been piloted and I even got a mini $1400 grant for it. Unfortunately, I burned through my money pretty quickly during the pilot\/trying different ideas out and I now have to drop another $800+ on my advisor's dime. I'm up against a time pressure and I know I need to just do it, but I can't not think in terms of regular person money and I get so so nervous!! I've resorted to loading smaller amounts of money into Prolific, which generates an annoying number of receipts to be processed.   \nSome of the anxiety is because I transferred into this lab in the last year, so I feel like all of my expenses are unplanned expenses. Something that makes me feel better is that my advisor was accepting students this round and ultimately didn't, so that tells me that she was prepared to support another student even after taking me on. She's the head of the department and quite well known, so if there were ever a lab to try out different ideas in, it would be this one. But I'm not on a grant and I don't know where her discretionary money comes from.   \nAfter the failed pilots (which was expensive), she even told me that I need something to work so I can design some follow up studies (clock is ticking), so we might as well \"throw money\" at the problem. Another explicit blessing.\n\n  \nI'm sure I'm not the only one who stresses over this.

I have a bit of data collection left to do, but it will be done by the end of this month, then I'll just be submitting papers, editing, preparing the dissertation and presentation, etc.. \n\nBad news: I'm really nervous about the questions. My oral quals went... okay, but it definitely could have gone better. There is one prof in particular, who is super knowledgeable and helpful, and I really respect their opinion. However, I've noticed that if you answer a question incorrectly, or don't know something they think you should know, they have a tendency to then really go in and ask way more intense questions. I know some people say it's okay to say you don't know... that has.. not been my experience with this professor. At one point I said I didn't know, and needed to look into something more, they got pretty frustrated with me and told me it was something I SHOULD know, and if I'm presenting it and don't know, that reflects badly on me. They were totally right, I really should have known the thing, honestly. BUT now I'm terrified I'll get asked something I don't know, knowing how it will go from there.\n\nAnyone have advice on how to anticipate\/be prepared for as many questions as possible? How do I figure out what I don't know? For context, I feel well prepared in general, I'm proud of my projects.

Your plan to review past feedback and chat with peers who've dealt with this professor is a solid one—it can provide valuable insights and help you feel more prepared. Just remember to keep an open mind and avoid overthinking; use their experiences as a guide, not a script. As for the defense itself, if you start feeling panic, try grounding techniques like focusing on your breath or a physical object, or mentally repeating a calming phrase like \"I've got this.\" Remember, it's normal to feel some level of anxiety, but you've got the tools to manage it. Keep practicing, and trust in your preparation—you've got this!\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate the encouragement and the reminder to not let others’ experiences turn into a rigid plan. I’ll keep practicing those grounding techniques too, and just try to trust that I’m ready for this.\n\nSo, I’m feeling a bit more confident after talking through all this, but I guess I’m still a little nervous about the actual day. Is it okay if we check in again closer to the defense, just to make sure I’m staying on track with these strategies?\ntherapist: It's completely normal to feel a bit nervous about the actual day, and I'm glad we could talk through these strategies to help you feel more confident. Checking in again closer to the defense is a great idea—it will give us a chance to review your progress and make any adjustments to your plan. I'll be here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident that you'll be ready for this important milestone. Keep practicing, and trust in your preparation—you've got this!\nclient: Thanks, I’m really grateful for your support and knowing I can check in again helps a lot. I’ll keep working on these strategies and try to stay focused on the progress I’m making.","completed":true}

Before I get into the details, I'll provide a bit of background.\n\nI'm currently a second and final year MSc Biology (2 yrs) international student in the Netherlands, and the way my program is designed, each year I am supposed to find an internship in order to progress and eventually graduate. The university recommends us to do the first internship in-house, meaning under the Faculty of Science and your respective department, only then for the second\/last internship you get to choose to do the internship in a company or another university (company or university can be locally or internationally, students have the option). \n\nI successfully completed my first internship already back in September 2022 and ever since then have been stuck in a hole trying to find an internship here in western Europe. I have tried companies locally and several neighboring countries as well as universities (across the Netherlands) but my efforts have proven to be fruitless thus far. Companies either do not reply or that they are not hiring during this period. In the meantime, I have just been calling and sending emails on a daily basis, even spoke to my program\/study advisor who gave me useful advice and suggestions but still nothing to show. Hell, I have even tried approaching\/connecting with potential employers via Linkedin after receiving such advice but apparently for some I require the premium package, which I do not have, in order to send them a message\n\nI feel like a failure because it's now January 2023 and due to my internship being a mandatory 6-month period in order to get the credits, this all means that I will definitely be graduating late. That, in turn, means more burden on my parents to financially support me.

It must be really hard to feel like you're not living up to your parents' expectations.\nclient: client: Yeah, it’s tough. I just keep thinking I’m supposed to have this figured out by now, and it’s eating at me that I don’t.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're feeling caught between your own expectations and your parents', which can be a really difficult spot to be in. I'm curious, how do you think your parents might feel if they knew how much this is weighing on you?\nclient: Honestly, I think they’d be worried and maybe a bit disappointed, but they’d probably try to hide it to not make me feel worse. I just don’t want to burden them more than I already am, you know?\n\nI guess I keep wondering if I’m doing something wrong, like maybe my applications aren’t good enough or I’m not reaching out to the right places. It’s frustrating because I feel like I’m trying everything, but nothing’s clicking. What do you think I could do differently, or is this just how it is sometimes?\ntherapist: It's clear that you're putting in a lot of effort, and it's understandable that you're feeling frustrated when it doesn't seem to be paying off. It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of self-doubt and pressure, which can make it hard to see your own strengths and progress. Have you considered talking to your parents openly about how you're feeling, or maybe seeking support from a career counselor to help you navigate this challenging process?\nclient: Yeah, I’ve thought about talking to my parents, but I’m kinda scared it’ll just make them worry more or think I can’t handle things on my own. As for a career counselor, I’ve met with my program advisor a bit, but maybe I need to push harder for more specific help or something. I don’t know, I just feel stuck, like no matter what I do, I’m not getting anywhere. Do you think just opening up to my parents could really help, even if it feels awkward?\ntherapist: It can be difficult to open up to your parents about your struggles, especially when you're worried about their reaction. However, it's possible that sharing your feelings with them could help you feel less alone in this process and might even lead to unexpected support or insights. Would you be open to exploring what it would be like to have that conversation with your parents, and how it might make you feel?\nclient: Yeah, I’m willing to think about it, though I’m still nervous about how it might go. I guess I just need to figure out how to even start that convo without feeling like I’m letting them down.\n\nHonestly, it’s hard to imagine them not being stressed about me already, and I don’t wanna add to that. But maybe you’re right, maybe they’d get where I’m coming from if I just lay it out. What do you think would be a good way to bring it up without it feeling like I’m just complaining or asking for more help?\ntherapist: You could start by acknowledging their concern and letting them know you value their support, while also expressing your own feelings in a way that shows you're taking responsibility for your situation. Something like, \"\"Mom and Dad, I know you care about me and want the best for my future. I’ve been struggling with job applications and feeling stuck, and I wanted to talk to you about it because I know you understand how important this is to me. I’m not looking for you to fix anything, but it would mean a lot if we could just talk about how I’m feeling.\"\" This way, you're opening up while also showing that you're proactive and self-aware.\nclient: Thanks for the suggestion, that actually sounds like a decent way to start. I like how it doesn’t come off as me just whining, but more like I’m trying to keep them in the loop.\n\nI’m still kinda worried they might take it the wrong way or start stressing more, though. I mean, they’ve already got enough on their plate without me piling on. Do you think there’s a way to, like, reassure them in that same convo that I’m still working hard on this, even if I’m struggling?\ntherapist: You could add something like, \"\"I know you're both worried about me, and I appreciate that, but I want to reassure you that I'm still putting in the work and doing my best.

{"id":"11v1z0j","timestamp":1679097600000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"My 2 year program has a cohort of 30 people and I feel like I’m always finding out about gatherings after the fact. Last semester, I consistently saw Snapchat\/IG stories and updates on bar hang outs, games, and more literally every week. Sometimes even more. But they were usually during or after the event. I tried to participate but how am I supposed to attend if I had no idea it was happening? And it’d get awkward when I was asking “what’s going on?” or “what are you guys talking about?”. Someone once even said “Poor (my name), she keeps thinking there’s a group chat for this when we plan it spontaneously”. I just get left out because no one tells me. I get that I’m more introverted, but I really do try to talk and participate in conversations and have been mistaken as an extrovert by an extrovert before. I’ve really worked on this over the years. And other introverts in the class somehow also find out about the events, parties, and gatherings. \n\nPart of me felt ok - I tried to make myself feel better by saying that those people just don’t have a life outside of the program. And that I wanted to have more of a balance. Seeing the same people 5 days a week a day PLUS some evenings and most weekends is a lot! On top of 5-6 classes and student clubs and volunteering, I have a GA position, casual job, serious relationship, family, and other friends to balance. I feel ridiculous and in the minority for feeling this way. \n\nNow that it’s March, there seems to be less of these events happening second semester, but it still hurts when someone sends a video or picture (e.g. group selfie) to the cohort group text and it’s like almost everybody is in it. This literally happened last night at 2AM for someone’s st patty party. I can’t silent the notifications or not check because sometimes there are important announcements to know. I try to shrug it off and not let it get to me but I feel ashamed that I’ve cried over this before.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello!

I'm here to listen, and I'm glad you've reached out for support. What's been on your mind lately?\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here. I’ve just been feeling really left out with my grad school cohort and it’s been bugging me a lot.\ntherapist: That must be really tough. Can you tell me a bit more about what’s been making you feel this way?\nclient: Yeah, it’s just this constant sense of being on the outside looking in with my group. I keep missing out on stuff and it’s starting to weigh on me more than I’d like.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're feeling like an outsider in a situation where you really want to belong. Can you tell me more about what you mean by missing out on stuff?\nclient: Yeah, it’s like I’m always a step behind on what’s happening with everyone. I just feel invisible sometimes, you know, and it’s frustrating because I really want to be a part of things.\ntherapist: That sounds incredibly frustrating and lonely. I can see how much it means to you to feel connected to your cohort. Can you tell me a bit more about what it would mean for you to feel like a part of the group, and what might be holding you back from feeling that way?\nclient: Honestly, being part of the group would mean feeling like I’m truly included, like I matter to them and I’m not just an afterthought. I think what’s holding me back is maybe not knowing how to break into those closer circles, especially since I’m not always around for the spontaneous stuff and I’m juggling so much already.\ntherapist: That's a really important insight. Can you tell me a bit more about what would need to happen for you to feel like you matter to them, and how you might start to bridge that gap between where you are now and where you want to be?\nclient: I guess for me to feel like I matter, I’d need to be looped into things more, like someone reaching out to invite me or just keeping me in the loop before stuff happens. As for bridging the gap, I’m not sure—maybe I could try being more upfront about wanting to join in, but it feels kinda awkward to ask, you know?\ntherapist: It's understandable that reaching out and asking to join in might feel awkward, especially if you're worried about being perceived as intrusive or disruptive. But it's worth considering that the only way to ensure you're included is to let others know that you're interested. Have you ever thought about how you might approach someone in a way that feels comfortable for you?\nclient: Yeah, I’ve thought about it a little, but I’m still kinda stuck on how to do it without feeling like I’m begging to be included. Maybe I could just casually mention to someone I’m close with that I’d love to hang out more, but I’m worried it might come off weird or desperate.\ntherapist: It's completely normal to feel hesitant about expressing your desire for inclusion, but remember that reaching out and communicating your needs is a brave and healthy step towards building connections. Perhaps you could start by sharing your thoughts with someone you feel most comfortable with, and see how they respond. What do you think might happen if you take that first step?\nclient: I think if I take that first step, it could either go really well and they’d be cool with including me more, or it might just feel super awkward if they don’t really get why I’m bringing it up. I’m just nervous about putting myself out there and then still feeling left out, ya know?\ntherapist: That's a valid concern, and it's natural to feel apprehensive about the potential outcome. However, it's important to remember that not taking that first step could mean missing out on an opportunity to build a stronger connection with someone. Perhaps you could focus on the positive possibility that they might be receptive to your feelings, and consider that even if they don't fully understand, you'll still have taken a step towards advocating for yourself.\nclient: Yeah, I get that focusing on the positive outcome could help, but it’s still kinda scary to think about putting myself out there and maybe not getting the response I hope for. I guess I just gotta remind myself that even if it doesn’t go perfectly, at least I tried, right?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're starting to see the potential benefits of taking that first step, even if the outcome is uncertain. And you're absolutely right—trying is a powerful act of self-advocacy, regardless of the response you receive. What might help is to consider some specific strategies that could make that initial conversation feel more comfortable and authentic for you.\nclient: I think maybe just keeping it super casual could help, like mentioning I’m down to hang out sometime if anything’s going on. I’m just not sure how to bring it up without overthinking it or making it a big deal, ya know?\ntherapist: It seems like keeping things casual is a great way to ease into the conversation. You could also consider framing it around shared interests or activities, like asking if they have any plans to check out that new movie or restaurant. How do you think that might feel for you?\nclient: I think that could feel pretty natural, like just casually asking about something we both might be into could take the pressure off. I’m just worried I’ll still overthink it in the moment and mess up the vibe, ya know?\ntherapist: Client, I'm really proud of you for considering these strategies and acknowledging your fears. It's natural to feel anxious about putting yourself out there, but remember that even small steps can lead to significant progress.

{"id":"123ppzd","timestamp":1679875200000,"category":"school_life","concern":"In undergrad, I was on top of my shit. Gears changing constantly. Though the classes were easier, there were more of them and the subjects were more varied. Work\/internship\/research. Student organizations. Events and planning. Prep for professional life and grad school. Social life. So many things, and I rarely if ever dropped the ball. I felt like a machine. Fulfilling and purposeful work. We were all ready to change the world.\n\nIn grad school, dropping the ball has become business as usual. Throughout my department, people drop commitments without announcement, show up late to meetings, miss deadlines, and send emails after the fact - sometimes apologetic and others accusatory. Presentations and papers are thrown together last minute, and lectures are permeated with the constant undertone, \"There are much better uses of my time than this,\" from both instructors and students. Resources to prepare for industry or education (anything outside of research, really) are scant - treated as obligatory by the department - and those who seek them out are viewed as admitting burnout or a lack of commitment or skill. Research is carried out with petty comments and measuring contests. People trade shady favors, becoming authors of papers to which they didn't contribute and exchanging techniques to fudge numbers and buy time. Those who are seated in tenured research positions seem constantly frazzled. If you ever ask them how to develop yourself, where to find meaning, how to generate questions and goals, you get a weak laugh and some half-hearted talk for 5min. Watching them work has been like watching someone stuck in a bad marriage. The encouragements that have come my way feel like the lies people tell themselves while losing religion.\n\nI've never caved to academic dishonesty, but I can't deny that the lack of professionalism has rubbed off on me. It's hard for anyone to generate sincerity and drive in a system this demoralizing. What happened?? How do I dig out?","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hi there!

Take your time to share whatever's on your mind - I'm all ears and ready to listen with care.\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here. I’m just feeling really lost with grad school and the whole environment—it’s nothing like I expected, and I’m struggling to keep my head above water.\ntherapist: That sounds really tough. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, especially when things aren't what you expected. Can you tell me more about what's been the hardest part so far?\nclient: client: Yeah, it’s just this constant sense of disappointment, you know? Like, I thought grad school would be challenging in a good way, but instead, it feels like I’m stuck in a mess of unprofessionalism and apathy that’s dragging me down.\ntherapist: It sounds like you’re feeling a real disconnect between what you imagined and what you’re actually experiencing. That sense of disappointment must be really frustrating and disheartening.\nclient: client: Yeah, exactly, it’s super frustrating. I just don’t know how to push through when it feels like the whole system is working against any kind of motivation or progress.\ntherapist: It's so disheartening when the system you're a part of doesn't seem to support your growth and progress. Can you tell me more about what you mean by unprofessionalism and apathy in your grad school environment?\nclient: Yeah, it’s like there’s just no accountability or passion around me, and it’s really draining. I guess I’m seeing a lot of behaviors and attitudes that make it hard to stay focused or care as much as I used to. \n\nI don’t know, maybe I’m just being too hard on myself or expecting too much, but it’s tough to keep pushing when it feels like no one else is even trying. How do you even start to rebuild that drive when the environment is just... bleh? Like, I want to get back to that sense of purpose I had before, but I’m not sure where to look for it right now.\ntherapist: I hear you, and it's clear that the environment you're in is really affecting your motivation and sense of purpose. It's important to remember that you're not the problem here, and your feelings are valid. Have you thought about what would need to change for you to feel more supported and motivated in your grad school journey?\nclient: Yeah, I’ve thought about it a bit, but I’m not really sure what could realistically change. Like, I wish there was more structure or accountability, or just some genuine encouragement from the people around me.\n\nHonestly, I feel kinda stuck trying to figure out what I can even control in this mess. Do you think it’s possible to find that motivation again without the whole environment shifting, or am I just fighting a losing battle here?\ntherapist: It's a really tough situation, and I can understand why you're feeling stuck. But it's important to remember that you're not powerless, and even small changes can make a difference. Let's focus on what you can control, like setting your own goals and finding ways to stay motivated and encouraged, even if the environment isn't ideal.\nclient: Yeah, that makes sense, I guess focusing on what I can control could help. I’m just not sure where to start with setting those goals when everything feels so off around me.\n\nLike, I want to get back to feeling driven, but it’s hard to even picture what that looks like right now. Do you have any ideas on how I can start small and kinda rebuild that sense of purpose without getting dragged down by the vibes in my department?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're open to exploring ways to regain your sense of purpose, and that's a positive step. Let's start by identifying one small goal that you can set for yourself, something that's achievable and aligns with your values. We can then brainstorm strategies to help you stay motivated and focused, even in a less-than-ideal environment.\nclient: Cool, I’m down to try that. I guess maybe a small goal could be getting back to a routine with my research, like setting aside specific times each week to really focus without distractions, since that used to make me feel productive.\n\nI’m not sure if that’s enough to get me feeling purposeful again, though. How do you think I can keep myself on track with something like that when I’m surrounded by so much apathy?\ntherapist: That's a great first step, and I think setting aside dedicated time for research is a smart way to start rebuilding your sense of purpose. To help you stay on track, you could try creating a schedule and tracking your progress, which can provide a sense of accomplishment and motivation. Additionally, finding ways to connect with others outside of your department who share your passion for research might help counterbalance the apathy you're experiencing. What do you think?\nclient: Yeah, I like the idea of tracking progress—maybe even just jotting down what I get done each day could give me a little boost. And connecting with people outside my department sounds good too, though I’m not sure where to start with that since most of my network is tied up in this mess.\n\nI guess I could look for some online forums or local meetups for researchers in my field. Do you think that’s a decent way to find people who might actually care about the same stuff I do, or should I be looking somewhere else?\ntherapist: Online forums and local meetups could be great places to start. You might also consider reaching out to old colleagues or classmates who share your passion for research. Even a small conversation with someone who understands your drive could help counterbalance the apathy around you.\nclient: Cool, I think reaching out to some old classmates could work—I’ve got a few in mind who were always pretty motivated, and it’d be nice to catch up anyway.

It's important to recognize your passion for counseling and emotional support, and that's something to be proud of. As we discussed, reaching out to an MSW advisor or professor is a small but meaningful step in understanding your options. It's okay to feel nervous about starting this conversation, but remember that it's about exploring possibilities rather than making a final decision. When you're ready, you could start by framing your inquiry as a way to learn more about the MSW program and its alignment with your interests in counseling. You might say something like, 'I'm curious about the MSW path and how it might align with my interest in counseling.' Be gentle with yourself throughout this process, and remember that you have the support of your peers and mentors, even as you explore new opportunities. Keep in mind that taking small steps can help you feel more comfortable and confident as you navigate this decision-making process.\nclient: **Client:** Thanks for breaking it down like that—it really helps to hear that taking small steps is okay and that I don’t have to have it all figured out right away. So, um, do you think I should just email someone in the MSW department to start, or is there a better way to approach this without it feeling so formal?\ntherapist: You're welcome! I'm glad that breaking it down helped. 🌟 As for reaching out to someone in the MSW department, an email is a great way to start, as it gives you time to craft your message thoughtfully. You could also consider stopping by their office hours or attending an MSW information session if available. Remember, the goal is to start a conversation, not to make a decision. Feel free to be casual and genuine in your approach. You could say something like, 'Hi, I'm a student in the School Psychology program and I'm curious about the MSW path and how it might align with my interest in counseling. I'd love to learn more about the program and any advice you might have for someone considering this path.' Take your time, and don't hesitate to reach out to me if you need further guidance or support. You've got this! 💪\nclient: **Client:** Thanks for the suggestion, I think starting with an email feels doable and less intimidating. So, um, should I mention anything about still being in my current program, or just keep it focused on being curious about MSW?","completed":true}

{"id":"119bwqj","timestamp":1677024000000,"category":"school_life","concern":"I graduated college less than a year ago (May 2022); and my undergraduate experience was already screwed up by COVID-19 - I was forced to skip out on a full year before returning to Senior year because the US did not allow international students to take hybrid classes and my university was not offering at least 3 in-person classes for me during the 2020 - 2021 lockdown. So I got to watch all my friends graduate without me; I did qualify for an accelerated Master's Program in Economics and I was accepted but I opted not to pursue it due to COVID-19 and feeling that I did not want to stay in Fordham for both undergraduate and graduate school.  \n\n\nAnyway, I somehow managed to get a short-term contract at the World Bank since they hired people from around the world, and if I work for the World Bank in a full-time job for about 15 years I am eligible for permanent residency (green card). For all intents and purposes I really want to stay and live and build a life in the US (especially now with geopolitical events in SE Asia). The problem is that I don't have options for employment in the private sector because the H1-b process is absurdly random and difficult; and the World Bank and IMF have outright told me that I can't get a fulltime job without AT LEAST a Master's Degree (it's already brutally difficult for me to get even a short-term contract role, let alone a fulltime job); and even this employment is not guaranteed.  \n\n\nI'm thinking of getting a Master's Degree in Statistics or Data Science (an MBA or Master's degree in economics isn't very helpful) but I have checked that I did not take enough undergrad courses in Math or Computer Science to qualify (at least in the US). I'm fairly certain that my math skills and coding skills are nowhere near good enough for grad school (I struggled for a 3.60 gpa even before COVID-19)  \nI'm honestly totally lost because I'm being forced to prepare for grad school so soon, just after I managed to find something solid career-wise (I'm 23 turning 24).

I feel like I’m stuck between needing to jump into grad school to secure my future here, but I’m not even sure I’m ready or qualified for it.\ntherapist: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when the stakes are high. I imagine it can be really hard to feel confident in your decision-making when there's so much uncertainty around your future.

For example, taking an online course might help you build specific skills that could be valuable in your research project or future grad school applications, while connecting with other researchers could lead to new ideas, collaborations, or mentorship opportunities. By considering these potential outcomes, you can make a more informed decision about how to allocate your time and energy this summer.\nclient: Hey, that makes a lot of sense, thanks for breaking it down like that. I think I’ll start by looking into a couple of online courses that focus on stats or modeling since those skills could directly help with my project, but I’m still kinda nervous about the networking part—any tips on how to even start reaching out to people without feeling super awkward?\ntherapist: It's completely normal to feel nervous about reaching out to people, but it's great that you're thinking about how to approach it in a way that feels comfortable and authentic. One tip might be to start small, by connecting with people you already have a connection with, such as professors, advisors, or peers who share your research interests. You could also try reaching out to people who have published work in your field, or who are involved in organizations or conferences related to your research. Remember, many people in academia and research are happy to offer advice and guidance to students who are genuinely interested in their work.\nclient: Hey, thanks for the advice, that actually sounds pretty doable. I think I’ll start by emailing a prof I’ve had a class with and maybe check out some online forums or groups related to ecology to see if I can join in on discussions without it feeling too forced.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're developing a solid plan for the summer, focusing on both skill-building and networking. What steps do you think would be most helpful to tackle first, and how might you anticipate potential challenges or setbacks along the way?\nclient: Hey, I’m glad you think it’s a solid plan. I think starting with that email to my prof is the first step since it feels less intimidating, and then I’ll look into those online forums; as for challenges, I’m kinda worried I might not get responses or I’ll come off as annoying, so maybe I need to figure out how to keep my messages short and to the point.\ntherapist: That's a great way to start, and your awareness of potential challenges is a good sign of your proactive approach. You could also consider practicing your email and messages with a trusted friend or advisor to get feedback and refine your approach. Additionally, you might think about how you'll handle any setbacks or disappointments, such as not getting responses, so that you can stay motivated and focused on your goals.\nclient: Hey, thanks for suggesting that idea about practicing my emails with someone I trust—that actually feels like a good way to ease my nerves a bit. I guess if I don’t get responses, I’ll just try to remind myself not to take it personally and maybe reach out to a couple more people or look for other ways to connect, like joining webinars or something; do you think that’s a decent backup plan?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're thinking through this thoroughly, and that's great. Your backup plan seems solid, as it gives you multiple avenues to explore and helps you stay proactive in the face of potential setbacks.\nclient: Hey, I’m really glad you think the backup plan sounds solid. I’m feeling a bit more confident now, but I’m still kinda wondering how to balance all this networking stuff with my ongoing research project over the summer, since I don’t want to drop the ball on that either.\ntherapist: Great to hear that your confidence is growing! Balancing networking and research can be challenging, but there are some strategies you can use to manage your time effectively. One idea is to set aside specific times each day or week for networking, such as an hour or two in the morning or evening, while dedicating the rest of your time to research. This way, you can focus on each task without feeling overwhelmed.\nAnother approach is to integrate your networking efforts with your research. For example, if you're working on a project related to population dynamics, you could look for online forums or webinars focused on that topic, which would allow you to network with experts in the field while also staying current with the latest research and developments.\nRemember, the key is to find a balance that works for you and to be flexible. If you find that your current plan isn't working as well as you'd hoped, don't hesitate to adjust it. The important thing is to keep moving forward and stay committed to your goals.\nclient: Hey, thanks for the tips on balancing things—I like the idea of setting specific times for networking so it doesn’t spill over into my research. Do you think it’s okay to start with just a small chunk of time each week and then adjust if I feel like I can handle more?","completed":true}

At the end of the internship we had to write a reflection essay about our experiences. However, this essay is reviewed by our advisor and depending on what they want the essays are very different. Most were 4-5 pages with a lot of self-reflection, one or two people got away with 1-2 pages. \n\nBut my advisor (who only has me as an advisee as they are on sabbatical) asked for a ten page paper which they have  returned FOUR  times for more editing. This most recent return they are asking me to add at least four paragraphs were I explain some books related to the internship topic, what their main points were, and how I felt those were reflected in my internship. No one else in my cohort was asked to do this but since I need advisor approval I am stuck adding all their demands. I’m the last one still working on this essay.\n\nAlso it needs to be submitted before the 21st so I can graduate so on top of finishing my capstone, regular work for class, and helping a sick family member, I have to work on this stupid essay.

I’ll try to focus on just a couple things each day and keep telling myself it’s okay if I don’t get everything done right away.\n\nI guess I’m just scared that even if I break it down, I’ll still fall behind, especially with my advisor’s slow responses. It’s like I’m trying to stay on top of stuff, but there’s always something out of my control messing things up. How do I deal with that frustration when it feels like no matter what I do, I’m still stuck waiting or stressing?\ntherapist: It’s understandable to feel frustrated when things are out of your control, but remember that you can still focus on the things you can control, like your own work and communication. It might help to reframe your mindset from seeing these delays as roadblocks to seeing them as opportunities to work on other tasks or take a break to recharge. Remember, progress is progress, no matter how slow it may seem. Keep in mind that you’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to ask for help when you need it.\nclient: Thanks for pointing that out—I hadn’t thought about using the waiting time as a chance to focus on other stuff or just take a breather. I’ll try to shift my thinking and see if that helps with the frustration.\n\nI’m just still kinda stuck on how to not let the waiting stress me out, you know? Like, I get that I can work on other things, but in the back of my mind, I’m always worrying about whether I’ll hear back in time or if I’m gonna miss some deadline. How do I quiet that nagging voice that keeps freaking me out about stuff I can’t control?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're already making progress by acknowledging the waiting time as an opportunity to focus on other tasks or take a break. Remember that it's normal to feel some level of stress or worry when waiting for responses, but try to remind yourself that you've done your part by reaching out and communicating your needs. \nInstead of letting the nagging voice take over, try to acknowledge the worry and gently refocus your attention on what you can control. For example, you could say to yourself, \"\"I've done what I can for now, and I'll revisit this concern when I receive a response.\"\" This can help quiet the worrying thoughts and allow you to move forward with the tasks at hand.\nclient: Thanks for the tip on acknowledging the worry and redirecting my focus—I think that could really help with calming that constant nagging in my head. I’ll try telling myself I’ve done what I can and just let it be for now.\n\nIt’s just hard to not keep checking my email every five minutes, you know? Like, I’m so anxious about missing something or not having enough time to fix stuff if my advisor finally gets back to me. How do I stop myself from obsessing over that and actually focus on other things?\ntherapist: One approach could be to set a specific time to check your email, maybe once or twice a day, and try to avoid checking it outside of those times. This can help break the cycle of constant checking and reduce the anxiety that comes with it. You could also try setting up notifications or reminders for when you need to check your email, so you can focus on other tasks without worrying about missing something important.\nclient: Thanks for the idea of setting specific times to check my email—that sounds like it could really help me stop obsessing over it. I’ll try to pick a couple of times a day and stick to that instead of constantly refreshing.\n\nI’m just worried that even with a schedule, I’ll still be thinking about it, you know? Like, what if I’m in the middle of working on something else and I just can’t shake the thought that I might be missing a crucial reply? How do I train myself to let go of that urge to keep checking just in case?\ntherapist: That's a valid concern, and it's important to acknowledge those thoughts without judgment. One strategy could be to create a \"\"worry journal\"\" or a \"\"concern list\"\" where you write down the thoughts and worries that pop up throughout the day. This can help you acknowledge and process those thoughts without letting them interrupt your focus. You could also try pairing this with a grounding exercise, like deep breathing or a quick mindfulness meditation, to help calm your mind and bring your attention back to the present moment.\nclient: Thanks for suggesting the worry journal and grounding exercises—that sounds like a practical way to get those nagging thoughts out of my head without letting them take over. I’ll definitely give that a shot and see if writing stuff down helps me feel less stuck on it.\n\nI guess I’m also just feeling kinda overwhelmed with how much is on my plate right now, you know? Like, even if I manage to stop obsessing over the email, I’ve still got so many other things piling up that it’s hard to know where to start. How do I even begin to prioritize when everything feels urgent?\ntherapist: One strategy to help you prioritize when everything feels urgent is to use the Eisenhower Matrix, which categorizes tasks into four quadrants based on their urgency and importance. This can help you identify which tasks are truly urgent and important, and which ones can be delegated, postponed, or eliminated. You can also try using a task list or planner to break down your tasks into smaller, manageable steps and focus on completing one step at a time.\nclient: Thanks for bringing up the Eisenhower Matrix and the idea of breaking tasks into smaller steps—that sounds like a solid way to get a handle on things. I’ll try mapping out what’s most urgent and important to see if that helps me feel less buried.\n\nI just keep feeling like no matter how I organize stuff, there’s not enough time in the day, you know? Like, I’m juggling so much that even the idea of sitting down to prioritize feels like another task on the list. How do I deal with that sinking feeling that I’m always gonna be behind?\ntherapist: I understand your frustration, and it's important to remember that managing your workload and prioritizing tasks is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. Be patient with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. Here's a summary of the strategies we discussed:\n- Set specific times to check your email to reduce the urge to constantly refresh and decrease anxiety.\n- Use a \"\"worry journal\"\" or \"\"concern list\"\" to write down thoughts and worries that pop up throughout the day, and pair this with grounding exercises like deep breathing or mindfulness meditation to help calm your mind.\n- Utilize the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks based on their urgency and importance, and break down tasks into smaller, manageable steps.\n- Consider using a task list or planner to keep track of your tasks and deadlines, and focus on completing one step at a time.\nOur next session will focus on further exploring these strategies and identifying any additional tools that can help you manage your workload and reduce stress. Remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate small victories along the way.\nclient: Thanks for summarizing everything we’ve talked about—I really appreciate having those strategies to lean on. I’ll do my best to be patient with myself and start small.\n\nHey, before we wrap up, do you think it’s okay if I check in with you sooner if I’m still feeling really swamped? I just want to make sure I’m not letting things spiral too much.","completed":true}
{"id":"sgr9nu","timestamp":1643587200000,"category":"academic","concern":"So first time I took the comp exam (civil engineering), I was told I passed! I told everyone and celebrated and moved on with my life.\n\n2 weeks after grades were posted I was told it was a clerical error and that I did not pass. I was crushed, as you can imagine. What made things even worse was when more people would congratulate me after I found out it was an error. I decided not to tell anyone of this error (except my wife and parents) in hopes that I would pass the second attempt.\n\nUnfortunately, I failed that test too. So now, the committee has given me another opportunity to get my hard earned diploma. I don't know if this is common, or that they're just giving me a break for crushing my life after informing me of the clerical error mishap. The task is an oral exam with a single written question on the most difficult course I've taken, and I'm which I did the absolute worst in.\n\nThe test is in less than a month, and I have approximately 3 full weekends to study and I have been given big hints for the question.\n\nI am now in the works of pairing with a professional tutor and am preparing all my questions for the time with the tutor.\n\nI have been really unable to sleep through the night these passed few days from the severe anxiety I am feeling. So, what should I do during the week that I am not working with the tutor?\n\nShould I just continue to review during the week? Btw I have a full time demanding engineering job at which I come home around 7:30 during the week.\n\nSorry if I'm all over the place, I just want to know what I should do so I can finally put this behind me.\n\nEdit- I passed the exam!

Can you tell me more about what's been feeling the most overwhelming lately?\nclient: Yeah, it’s just this constant pressure of deadlines creeping closer, and I’m worried I won’t get it all done in time. I’ve got a plan to push through, but it’s hard to keep up the pace without feeling like I’m drowning.\ntherapist: It’s clear how much effort and dedication you’re putting into your PhD and work, but the stress of deadlines can really take a toll. It’s normal to feel like you’re struggling to keep up, especially when there’s so much on the line. How have you been managing to cope with this pressure so far?\nclient: Honestly, I’ve been just trying to stick to a schedule, like setting daily goals for writing and stuff. It helps a bit, but some days I’m just so wiped out from work that I can barely focus, you know?\ntherapist: It's amazing how much effort you're putting into staying on top of things, and it sounds like your schedule is a helpful tool, even if it's not perfect. It's totally normal to feel drained after a long day at work, and it's great that you're being honest with yourself about your limits. How do you feel about the balance between your PhD and work right now - are there any parts of it that feel more manageable than others?\nclient: Honestly, the balance feels pretty off most of the time, like I’m constantly playing catch-up. I guess the writing goals are sorta manageable when I can focus, but work just drains so much energy that it’s hard to keep up momentum.\ntherapist: It sounds like your schedule has been a helpful anchor, even if it's been a bit rocky lately. I'm curious, what do you think might happen if you were able to carve out even a small bit of extra time for yourself each day - maybe to recharge or just breathe?\nclient: Honestly, I think even a tiny bit of extra time could make a huge difference, like just a moment to clear my head might help me focus better. I’m not sure how to make that happen with everything piling up, but it’s something I’d love to figure out.\ntherapist: It's interesting how even a small change in your daily routine could have a positive impact on your focus and overall well-being. What do you think would be the most challenging part of finding that extra time for yourself?\nclient: Honestly, the toughest part would probably be just letting go of the guilt of not working on something every second. Like, I feel this constant pressure to be productive, so stepping away even for a bit feels almost wrong, you know?\ntherapist: It's really insightful of you to recognize that guilt and pressure to be productive might be holding you back. That's a common challenge, and it's worth exploring how you can reframe self-care as a valuable investment in your overall well-being and productivity.\nclient: Yeah, I get that reframing it as an investment makes sense, but it’s hard to shake that nagging feeling that I’m slacking if I’m not grinding. I guess I just need some kinda way to convince myself that taking a break isn’t gonna derail everything I’m working toward.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're caught between wanting to prioritize self-care and the fear that it might hinder your progress. What if we explored how taking small breaks could actually enhance your focus and overall productivity, rather than detract from it?\nclient: Yeah, I’d be down to explore that, because I really do want to find a balance without feeling like I’m sabotaging myself. Like, if I could see proof that small breaks actually help me get more done, I think I could start to ease up on myself a bit.\ntherapist: That's a really interesting idea. Have you noticed any moments where taking a break actually helped you come back to a task with renewed energy and focus?\nclient: Yeah, I can think of a couple times when stepping away for a bit, like going for a quick walk, actually cleared my head and made it easier to dive back in. It’s just hard to remember that in the moment when I’m stressing about deadlines, you know?\ntherapist: It’s really helpful that you can reflect on those moments where taking a break actually helped you feel more focused and energized. Let’s brainstorm some specific strategies that could help you remember to step away and recharge when you’re feeling stressed about deadlines. Maybe we could try creating a simple routine or reminder system that signals to you that it’s time to take a break and give yourself permission to recharge?\nclient: Yeah, I think having some kind of reminder system could be really useful, especially since I tend to get so caught up in the grind that I forget to step back. Like, maybe setting a timer or something on my phone to nudge me to take a breather would help me actually stick to it.\ntherapist: That sounds like a solid starting point, and I love the idea of leveraging technology to support your self-care. What if we also brainstormed some other low-effort reminders, like setting a recurring calendar event or even using a physical timer on your desk? And maybe we could explore what kind of break activities feel most rejuvenating for you, so you can have a go-to list when the timer goes off?\nclient: Yeah, I’m totally open to trying out different reminders like a calendar event or a desk timer—those could be good backups if my phone doesn’t cut through the noise of my focus. And figuring out what kinds of breaks actually recharge me sounds super helpful, ‘cause sometimes I just stare at my phone and don’t really feel better after, you know?\ntherapist: That’s a great point about needing to find break activities that actually recharge you, not just distract you. Let’s build a personalized list of break ideas that feel meaningful and energizing to you, so you can choose one that works in the moment when the timer goes off.\nclient: Yeah, I’m all for coming up with a list of break ideas that actually leave me feeling refreshed instead of just killing time. I’m thinking maybe stuff like stepping outside for a few minutes or even just stretching at my desk could do the trick, but I’d love to hear any other suggestions you’ve got.\ntherapist: As we wrap up this session, I want to commend you for your self-awareness and willingness to explore strategies to support your well-being. Remember, taking breaks is essential for your productivity and overall health. To recap, we've discussed setting up reminders, such as a phone timer or calendar event, and creating a personalized list of rejuvenating break activities.\nFor the next step, I encourage you to start implementing these strategies and notice how they impact your productivity and stress levels. Don't forget to be kind to yourself and give yourself permission to take breaks when needed. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and I'm here to support you along the way. Let's schedule a follow-up session to check in on your progress and continue working together to find the best balance for your PhD and work responsibilities.\nclient: Thanks for the encouragement and for summarizing our plan—I really appreciate the support. I’ll start trying out these reminders and break ideas this week and see how they feel. Can we schedule that follow-up for next month, maybe around the same time?","completed":true}
{"id":"yvmofn","timestamp":1668470400000,"category":"academic","concern":"Hi all,\n\nI am an MBA student in the back half of my program with 4 classes left. I am in the second most challenging class in the degree supposedly at the moment, and while it is a lot of work it didn't seem tough when given the time at the beginning of the semester. The issue is, I haven't been able to put the time in to succeed and it is really hitting me mentally, I can't decide what to do at the moment. \n\nI recently lost both my great aunt and uncle (basically my grandparents, the closest people in my life outside of my immediate family) within two weeks of each other and have had to travel across the USA to support my family and be there as my aunt passed away at the end. For reference, my aunt and uncle lived in the northeast while my family is located in southern FL. My immediate family is extremely close and my mother has been away from the family providing care every step of the way in conjunction with Hospice, not leaving their side since her arrival there in early September. On top of this, my maternal grandparents and maternal uncle (who have been mentally abusive of my mother for my entire life, the reason we moved down south) have been treating the family terribly and causing additional stress for my family and quite frankly I don't know how my mother has been able to deal with this whole thing. My uncle is a troublemaker who has been enabled throughout his life by my grandparents and has been to jail a few times for various issues that should have landed him more time in lockup. The conflict this time is over the fact certain people were not included in the will, and my mom is being blamed for us having control of the estate. We had a bat by the door the whole time we were at my great aunt and uncle's house and all decided nobody is leaving mom alone and we needed to be ready in case he showed up to cause issues. \n\nI say all this to mention that while I stayed there (4 weeks) from the beginning of October to a few days ago, I had no access to the internet on the trip minus randomly stopping at a local community college to try and do some work one day for class. Essentially every waking moment I was there I was with the family and trying to provide support for my mom, and I lost track of this class and got so far behind that I feel like I can't claw my way back at this point. I can drop the course, but I feel as if I am an abject failure for doing so. I thought about dropping earlier in the trip but figured I'd be able to get back on track when we left, but we stayed longer than anticipated and I feel as if that isn't the case.\n\n I'm 26 and feel like I should be done with my degree already, I don't want to put myself back by a semester when I am nearing the finish line, but I'm not sure what to do. I haven't completely coped with the situation to this point and am just looking for some insights or perspective on this. I am planning on having a conversation over the phone with my professor on Thursday, and my advisor has mentioned I can get out of the class affecting my degree given the circumstances. It still just makes me feel like I'm screwing myself so hard and wasting time. \n\nSorry for being long-winded. \n\nGot any ways to deal with the guilt of potentially dropping a class, and have any advice?","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello!

{"id":"sd6mlv","timestamp":1643155200000,"category":"emotional","concern":"It has been about 4.5 years since I graduated my PhD program and it still feels like it happened last year. I know that everyone has a different grad school experience but I definitely had some of the lowest moments \nof my life (along with a few of the best ones too). I wanted to post this because I wasn't sure if it might be relatable to some of you who are currently in a PhD\/masters program or recently graduated. Its not easy to share something intimate like this but if it helps someone then it is worth it. \n\nThis year, my wife and I did some soul searching and met with a mental health professional to work on understanding ourselves more and improving the quality of our relationship together. Through this experience I was able to understand how my experience in grad school shaped how I acted in my day to day life. I think the constant pressure of presenting positive results, delivering flawless presentations\/talks, mastering techniques, etc. in grad school can drive us to an unhealthy self-image of always needing to be always perfect. At least it did for me. Understanding, being comfortable with and even being happy with my imperfections has really helped me overcome this perfection complex.\n\nThe point of this post is just to say that there will always be failures, always be imperfections, and always be mistakes and that is ok. Grad school isn't easy and mistakes don't make you any less valuable as a person or a researcher. You are all valuable and amazing just the way you are no matter how many times things get messed up. Even if you don't believe that yet, I can say that I do and that is at least one person that believes in you.

What if we made it even more doable by picking a specific time today to try that five-minute break, maybe right after you finish your next task?\nclient: Hey, yeah, that sounds like a plan, I can pick a time after I wrap up this next chunk of work to just step away for a bit. I’m still a little jittery about losing momentum, but locking in a specific moment might help me actually do it.\ntherapist: That sounds like a solid plan. How about we also brainstorm a few ways to make sure you can ease back into your work flow after that break, so you don't feel like you've lost momentum?\nclient: Hey, yeah, that’d be really helpful to figure out some ways to get back into the groove without feeling all scrambled. I’m worried about just sitting there stressing about the clock, so maybe we can come up with something to make the transition smoother?\ntherapist: That’s a great point about wanting a smooth transition. What if we tried creating a short routine to signal the end of your break, like taking a few deep breaths or jotting down your next task before heading back to work? This might help you ease back in without feeling rushed or distracted.\nclient: Hey, yeah, I like the idea of a little routine to kinda reset my brain after the break. Maybe those deep breaths and writing down the next thing could keep me from spiraling about time, so I’m down to try that out.\ntherapist: Great job! You've made a great start by committing to a five-minute break and exploring strategies to smoothly transition back into your work. Remember, taking breaks isn't a sign of weakness or laziness - it's a way to recharge and increase your productivity in the long run. Your plan to create a short routine, such as deep breathing and jotting down your next task, is an excellent way to ease back into your work flow without feeling rushed or distracted.\nKeep in mind that it's okay to feel a bit jittery about losing momentum at first, but with practice, you'll find that taking breaks can actually help you stay on track and manage your workload more effectively. Don't be too hard on yourself if you struggle at first - just keep practicing your routine and remember that progress is not a straight line. You've got this!\nclient: Hey, thanks for the encouragement and for reminding me that it’s okay to take breaks. I’m still a bit nervous about getting the hang of this, but I’m feeling more hopeful about making it work with these strategies.","completed":true}

{"id":"wljagq","timestamp":1660176000000,"category":"emotional","concern":"I’ve officially just joined my lab and I’ve been having a rough first couple months trying to get a complicated  cloning project to work. I’m inexperienced in molecular cloning, but I’m now on my twelfth (!) attempt and I’m feeling very down and it’s hard not to take it to heart. \n\nI’ve made various mistakes along the way. Once, on attempt 9 I did something truly stupid (wrong antibiotic lol) but I caught and fixed it quickly and it just took a few extra hours. Once we ran out of a key reagent because someone left an empty tube in a box and never ordered more (it was difficult to see it was empty before I thawed it) so I had to start over. Another time the undergrad intern used all 30 vials of the bacteria I needed the morning I needed them, without informing anyone. So my fault for only checking the freezer the morning of the experiment and not immediately before starting, but also in my opinion this is a broader lab organization issue. The other times were issues by relying on protocols that were not well-optimized for my project (par for the course I guess). The latest is that I now need to re-design most of my strategy as I was following the instructions of someone who did a cloning project with the same backbone only to find that their instructions were incorrect and ignored a key gene in the vector. This is something I feel awful for not catching sooner in hindsight but again, I am inexperienced so it did not jump out to me until my PI finally noticed it today. \n\nI’m not repeating the same mistakes but the sheer number of mistakes on the same step of a project is making me feel like I’m the problem.

Until this week, I had been at my parents' house doing online school from there. While I'm definitely not the biggest proponent of online school, I was actually really enjoying life at home. I got to focus on doing readings and work without worrying about maintaining my own living space, I didn't have a commute to and from classes, and I really enjoyed hanging out with my family every day. Now I'm in a different city which is still pretty shut down from the pandemic, living alone, I can't see anyone, I haven't been able to focus on my coursework that much, and I just feel really *lonely* especially since the people in my cohort aren't keen on getting together due to the pandemic. Even though I absolutely love my program and what I'm studying, I'm starting to question if it's worth the lifestyle choices that are necessary (e.g., moving away from home, the job search being global rather than local). Now, I'm finding myself wishing the weeks would pass until I can go back during the break. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way and how they cope with it.

I'm so glad you're here, and I'm ready to listen and support you in any way I can. Please feel free to share whatever's on your mind, and know that this is a safe and nonjudgmental space for you to express yourself. What would you like to talk about today?\nclient: Thanks for being here to listen. I’ve been feeling really lonely and out of place since moving back to the city for in-person classes, and I’m just struggling with whether this whole grad school experience is worth the sacrifices I’m making.\n\nHey, I guess I just wanna dive into how hard it’s been adjusting to being on my own again after being so comfortable at my parents’ place. Like, I’m in this new space, everything’s still pretty shut down, and I can’t even connect with people in my program because everyone’s being super cautious, which I get, but it just leaves me feeling stuck and kinda down all the time. I’m wondering if this is just how grad school is, or if I’m missing something, you know?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of uncertainty right now, and that can feel really heavy. Your feelings of loneliness and doubt are completely valid, and it's okay to feel that way. It's understandable that adjusting to a new environment and feeling isolated can make you question whether this experience is worth the sacrifices you're making. Can you tell me more about what led you to choose grad school, and how your expectations compare to your current reality?\nclient: Thanks for understanding how heavy this feels. I guess I chose grad school because I’m super passionate about my field, and I thought it would open up amazing opportunities, but right now, it just feels like I’m giving up a lot of comfort and connection for something that’s not as fulfilling as I expected.\n\nYou know, I was so excited to dive into this program and really grow, both academically and personally, but now I’m just sitting in my apartment most of the time, not even able to grab coffee with someone or join a study group. I thought grad school would be challenging in a good way, like pushing me to think deeper, but instead, I’m just wrestling with feeling so alone—do you think this is just a temporary thing because of the pandemic, or is grad school kinda always this isolating?\ntherapist: It’s really brave of you to share this, and it’s clear that you’re trying to balance your passion for your field with the challenges of adjusting to this new chapter. I can imagine that the contrast between your expectations and your current reality is especially difficult, especially with the added layer of the pandemic. It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of questions about whether this experience is worth the sacrifices you’re making. Would you be open to exploring some of these questions together?\nclient: Yeah, I’d definitely be open to exploring these questions with you. I just feel so torn, you know, between loving what I’m studying and hating how disconnected I feel, and I’m not sure how to reconcile that or if it’s even possible right now.\ntherapist: It sounds like you’re caught in a challenging tug-of-war between your passion for your field and the emotional costs of this transition. That’s a really tough spot to be in, and I appreciate how openly you’re sharing your struggle. Can you help me understand what parts of your program still ignite that passion, and what parts of your old routine you miss the most? Sometimes zooming in on those details can help us untangle the mixed feelings.\nclient: Thanks for helping me unpack this—it really does feel like a tug-of-war. I’m happy to dive into what still excites me about my program and what I’m missing from before, because I think that might help me figure out what’s weighing on me so much.\n\nSo, like, the parts of my program that still get me pumped are definitely the readings and discussions when I can actually focus—they’re so thought-provoking, and I feel like I’m learning stuff I couldn’t anywhere else. But then, I miss just chilling with my family after a long day, not having to worry about cooking or cleaning as much, and just having people around who already get me, you know? I guess I’m wondering if there’s a way to hold onto that excitement for my studies while also finding some sense of comfort or connection here, even if it’s not the same as being at home. How do you think I can start bridging that gap, or at least feel less stuck in this weird in-between?\ntherapist: It’s really insightful of you to recognize that your passion for the readings and discussions is still there, even amidst all the challenges. Maybe we can start by exploring what small, manageable ways you could create pockets of connection here, like joining online discussion groups or reaching out to classmates for virtual study sessions. What do you think would make those interactions feel more like a bridge between your current isolation and the comfort you miss?\nclient: Thanks for suggesting those ideas—I’m definitely open to trying some virtual connections to see if that helps. I guess I’d want those interactions to feel casual and personal, not just about schoolwork, like maybe chatting about random stuff over Zoom to mimic that easy vibe I had with my family; what do you think are some good ways to make those kinds of conversations happen with classmates who are also kinda keeping their distance right now?\ntherapist: I think you're onto something really important here. Creating those casual, personal moments with classmates can be a great way to start building that sense of connection. Maybe you could start by suggesting a virtual coffee break or a movie night over Zoom? Those kinds of activities can help create a relaxed atmosphere where people feel more comfortable opening up. You could also try sharing a bit about yourself during class discussions, like mentioning a funny experience or a hobby you enjoy. That might encourage others to do the same, and help create a sense of camaraderie.\nclient: Thanks for the suggestions—I think a virtual coffee break or movie night sounds like a chill way to start connecting without it feeling forced. I’m a bit nervous about putting myself out there, especially since everyone seems so cautious right now, but I like the idea of just sharing small stuff about myself in class to test the waters; do you have any tips on how to bring up those casual topics without it feeling awkward or out of place?\ntherapist: You could try weaving in casual topics naturally during class discussions, like mentioning how a reading reminded you of a favorite book or movie, or sharing a personal anecdote related to the topic at hand. That way, you're staying relevant to the conversation while also opening up a bit. You might also consider starting a group chat with classmates and sharing funny memes or interesting articles to break the ice and create a more relaxed atmosphere.\nclient: Thanks for the advice—I like the idea of tying personal stuff into class discussions so it doesn’t feel random or weird.

What are some steps you could take to encourage more people to join and participate in the GroupMe?\nclient: I guess I could start by posting more myself, like sharing something relatable about my day or asking a question to get people talking. Maybe I’ll also mention it to a few classmates or put up a quick note on some grad school boards to spread the word without being too pushy.\ntherapist: Based on what you've mentioned, you could consider creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere by sharing a relatable story or asking an engaging question to get people talking. Additionally, you might think about mentioning the GroupMe in your classes or posting about it on grad school boards to spread the word without being overly pushy.\nclient: Yeah, I like the idea of starting with something personal to break the ice, maybe even just a quick rant about a deadline or a funny lab mishap. I’ll try to casually bring it up with some peers too, see if they’re interested in joining the convo. How do you think I should handle it if people join but don’t really participate much at first?\ntherapist: If people join but don't participate right away, you could try gently encouraging them by asking for their thoughts or experiences on a topic you know they're familiar with. For example, you might say something like, \"\"Hey, I know you're an expert in X, what do you think about Y?\"\" This can help them feel included and valued in the conversation.\nclient: Cool, I like that approach of making it personal and drawing them out with something specific they can relate to. I’ll definitely give that a shot and see if it gets the ball rolling with some of the quieter folks. What if it still feels kinda one-sided, like I’m the only one trying to keep the chat alive—should I just keep pushing or step back a bit?\ntherapist: It's great that you're thinking about how to foster participation in the GroupMe. If you feel like you're the only one keeping the conversation alive, it's important to find a balance between engaging others and not overextending yourself. You might consider setting a goal to engage with at least one person each week, whether it's by asking for their thoughts on a topic or sharing something relatable from your own experience. This can help keep the conversation flowing without putting too much pressure on yourself. Remember, building a supportive community takes time and effort, and it's important to be patient and persistent. Keep up the good work!\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate the reminder to pace myself and not take on too much. I’ll try focusing on connecting with just a couple of people at a time and see how that goes. By the way, I’ve got a big presentation coming up next week, and I’m kinda stressing about it—do you have any quick tips for calming those nerves?","completed":true}

Please feel free to share whatever's on your mind, and I'll be here to listen and support you.\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here to chat. I’ve been stressing a bit about moving to a new city for my PhD and figuring out who to live with, and I’d really like to get your thoughts on that.\ntherapist: It sounds like a big life change is coming up for you, and that's definitely something to think through carefully. What are your biggest concerns about finding a place to live, and who are you considering as potential roommates?\nclient: I’m mostly worried about whether living with people from my program will blur the lines between personal and professional life, or if living with others outside my cohort might make it harder to connect on a deeper level. I’m torn between the convenience of shared experiences with classmates and the idea of having some separation to keep things balanced.\n\nSo, like, I’m wondering if you’ve seen other students deal with this kind of dilemma before? I mean, do most people end up happier living with folks from their program, or does branching out tend to work better for keeping some boundaries?\ntherapist: It's not uncommon for students to grapple with this very dilemma, and it's important to consider what works best for you. While some find that living with classmates can foster a sense of community and shared understanding, others prefer the balance and separation that comes with living outside of their academic circle. It's important to weigh your own needs and priorities, and to consider what will help you feel most supported and at ease during this significant life transition.\nclient: Thanks for that perspective; it’s helpful to know I’m not alone in wrestling with this. I guess I’m just trying to figure out what balance looks like for me, you know?\n\nLike, if I do live with people outside my program, should I still aim for other PhD students who might get the grad school grind, or does it not really matter as long as they’re cool to live with? I’m kinda worried I might feel isolated if I’m not with people who understand the stress of a PhD.\ntherapist: It's clear you're putting a lot of thought into this, and that's a great sign that you're prioritizing your well-being during this transition. You might consider exploring both options—reaching out to classmates and to other PhD students outside your program—to see where you feel most at ease. Sometimes, the right balance becomes clearer when we open ourselves up to different possibilities. What would you imagine a day in your life would look like if you found that perfect balance?\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate that advice to keep my options open. I think I just need to feel out what clicks for me, you know?\n\nIf I imagine a day with that perfect balance, I guess I’d come home after a long day of research or classes and feel like I can totally unwind. Like, I’d want roommates who get the stress of grad school but aren’t so tied to my specific program that we’re always talking shop—maybe we’d just chill, watch a show, or grab a quick dinner without it turning into a study session. I think that kind of separation would help me recharge. So, how do I even start finding people like that—should I just post on some grad student forums or ask around once I get there?\ntherapist: That vision of unwinding after a long day sounds incredibly inviting and well-deserved. Finding the right balance often starts with small, organic connections—maybe checking out grad student social events or even joining study groups outside your program could lead to meaningful relationships. Have you considered reaching out to any of your professors or classmates for recommendations?\nclient: Thanks, that idea of starting with small connections feels doable. I haven’t thought about asking professors or classmates for recs yet, but that could be a good way to find people who vibe with what I’m looking for.\n\nI guess I’m also a bit nervous about how to bring up the whole roommate thing without it feeling awkward, you know? Like, how do I ask someone if they’re looking for a place or if they know someone who is, without coming off as pushy or weird?\ntherapist: It’s completely natural to feel a bit uneasy about bringing up the topic of roommates, but it can be as simple as casually mentioning that you’re looking to find a place and asking if they know anyone who might be interested in sharing an apartment or house. You could also try using a lighthearted approach, like saying something like, “I’m on the hunt for a roommate who understands the grad school grind but isn’t too obsessed with their research—any suggestions?” Remember, the goal is to keep it relaxed and friendly, and you can always gauge their reaction and adjust your approach accordingly.\nclient: Thanks, that casual approach feels way less intimidating. I like the idea of just tossing it out there like it’s no big deal, and seeing how people respond.\n\nI’m also wondering, though, if I should be upfront about wanting that balance—like, should I straight-up say I’m looking for someone who gets grad school but isn’t in my program, or just keep it vague at first? I don’t want to scare people off by seeming too picky, you know?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're thinking through the best approach to find a roommate who understands your needs without seeming too demanding. Being upfront about your desire for a roommate outside your program could help attract the right people, but it's also important to be open to unexpected connections. Maybe you could start with a casual mention of your ideal roommate situation and gauge the other person's response before diving deeper into the specifics? That way, you're sharing your preferences without potentially scaring off someone who might still be a great fit.\nclient: Thanks, that makes a lot of sense.

{"id":"sakqfv","timestamp":1642896000000,"category":"school_life","concern":"So I got my MA in History in May, 2021, from a terminal program - but I wasn't accepted to any of the PhD programs I applied to, my advisor and I were pretty sure, because of all the schools in 2020-21 who froze PhD admissions altogether to conserve funding for current students during the pandemic causing a snowball effect that everyone who applied to those schools (i.e Cornell) to apply to other schools they wouldn't have initially. \n\nSo here I am, unemployed because minimum wage places won't hire me (\"Overqualified\") and without the certification to teach history in a high school or do anything with my degree applying to PhD programs again. In the time since the last admissions round, I've signed a deal with a publisher to publish my MA thesis as a book, which is due out in June, but hasn't been listed for pre-order or sale anywhere yet to prove that it's real to admission committees and not just a CV invention, so I'm worried that won't be enough to give me a leg up in admissions. My MA GPA was a 4.0, but my undergrad GPA was absolutely awful. \n\nI have received one email from a member of an admissions committee from one of the schools I applied to asking whether \"the retirement of \\[a professor I had expressed interest in working in\\] would affect whether or not you choose to attend\" that school. \n\nAm I panicking unnecessarily?

I'm here to listen and support you, so please feel free to share whatever's been on your mind lately. What would you like to talk about?\nclient: Thanks for being here. I’m just really stressed about my PhD applications and my future in general, you know?\ntherapist: That sounds like a lot to handle. I can see how PhD applications and thinking about your future might feel overwhelming right now. What parts of this process have been weighing on you the most?\nclient: Client: It’s mostly the uncertainty, like not knowing if I’ll even get into a program after last year’s rejection mess. And I’m just stuck, not working, not moving forward, and wondering if I’m even cut out for this path.\n\n[Continuing the conversation as the client]\n\nClient: I mean, I worked so hard on my MA, got a 4.0, and now I’ve got this book deal coming up, which is awesome, but I’m freaking out that it won’t even matter to admissions committees since it’s not out yet. I just feel like I’m spinning my wheels, you know? Like, am I just wasting my time applying again, or should I be looking at other options, even though I don’t even know what those would be?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're caught in a whirlwind of doubts and fears, even with your impressive achievements. I can see how that uncertainty about your future could feel paralyzing, especially when you're putting so much of yourself into these applications. It's understandable to wonder if you're just spinning your wheels, but it's also important to remember that you've already accomplished so much. Let's take a step back and try to untangle some of these thoughts together, shall we?\nclient: Client: Yeah, I’d really appreciate that. I just don’t know where to start with untangling all this mess in my head, you know, like whether I should keep pushing for a PhD or if I’m just setting myself up for more disappointment.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're caught in a whirlwind of doubts and fears, even with your impressive achievements. Let's take a step back and try to untangle some of these thoughts together, shall we?\nclient: Client: Yeah, I’m totally down to try that. I just feel so stuck, like I’m torn between keeping at this PhD dream and worrying I’m just gonna crash and burn again, you know?\ntherapist: That tension between pursuing your dream and the fear of another setback is really understandable. Let's take a step back and imagine two possible paths: one where you keep pushing for the PhD, and another where you explore other options. Which path feels more aligned with your values and long-term goals?\nclient: Client: Honestly, I’m not even sure right now. The PhD path feels like it’s who I am, like I’ve put so much into history and research, but the fear of another rejection just guts me, and I don’t know if I can handle that again. On the other hand, I have no clue what else I’d even do—everything else feels like giving up, you know?\ntherapist: It's okay to feel stuck between two paths that both carry significant weight for you. Let's focus on the PhD path first: what values or long-term goals make it feel like such a big part of who you are?\nclient: **Client:** Yeah, I get that it’s okay to feel torn, and I appreciate you helping me break this down. With the PhD, it’s like... I’ve always seen myself as someone who digs deep into history, uncovers stories, and shares them—research and teaching feel like my purpose, you know? But then I wonder if I’m just clinging to this idea of myself because I don’t know who I’d be without it.\ntherapist: That purpose of uncovering and sharing stories feels like it's deeply rooted in who you are. It's brave to question whether it's still the right fit for you, especially when it's been such a big part of your identity. Have you considered what aspects of research and teaching give you the most fulfillment?\nclient: **Client:** Yeah, I’ve thought about that a bit. Like, I love the thrill of piecing together a story from old documents, finding something no one’s noticed before, and then sharing it in a way that makes people care about the past. It’s that moment of connection—whether it’s writing or talking to a class—that just lights me up, you know? But then I worry if I’m romanticizing it, ‘cause the grind of academia, the rejection, the uncertainty... it’s brutal, and I don’t know if I’m strong enough to keep taking the hits. What if I’m just chasing a feeling that’s not even real anymore?\ntherapist: That connection you feel when sharing your discoveries and inspiring others sounds like a powerful motivator. It's okay to question whether the dream still aligns with your current strengths and needs. Let's brainstorm ways to protect that spark of connection while also safeguarding your well-being, like exploring non-academic paths where you could still uncover and share stories in meaningful ways.\nclient: **Client:** Yeah, I’m open to brainstorming other paths, ‘cause I do wanna hold onto that feeling of connection, even if it’s not in a PhD program. Like, I’ve thought about maybe writing for a wider audience or working in a museum or something, but I don’t even know where to start with that, and I’m scared it won’t feel as fulfilling as I imagine academia could be. Have you got any ideas on how I could test out those kinds of roles without totally abandoning my original plan?\ntherapist: You're clearly committed to that feeling of connection, which is a great starting point for exploring alternatives. Maybe we could look at small steps to test those other paths - like shadowing someone in a museum or taking a writing workshop - while keeping your PhD options open. How does that sound?\nclient: **Client:** That sounds doable, actually. I like the idea of testing the waters with something like shadowing or a workshop—maybe it’ll give me a clearer picture of what I really want without feeling like I’m giving up on the PhD dream just yet. I’m just worried I’ll spread myself too thin, you know, trying to juggle these side explorations while still prepping apps and waiting on decisions. Do you think I can balance both, or should I just pick one focus for now?\ntherapist: Overall session summary: The client is feeling overwhelmed by stress regarding PhD applications and uncertainty about their future, particularly after a previous rejection. They are torn between pursuing their PhD dream and exploring other options, fearing disappointment while questioning their identity without the PhD path. The client expressed significant stress about their PhD applications and future, particularly influenced by past rejection.

I was accepted to the University of Utah BME PhD program (by some miracle), but I'm torn on whether to take another gap year or if I should take this opportunity since there's no guarantee I'd be admitted again next year. \n\nIf I do another gap year, I would have a minimum of three publications (I've got 3-4 that should be published by June), I would spend the year working as an RA in a lab in my desired field, and obtain letters of rec from three different organizations now that I've built stronger relationships. I REALLY LIKE the program at Utah, but I don't LOVE it and I would hate not giving it another go at a few programs that I LOVE. However, the thought of turning down such an awesome and unexpected offer has me kicking myself. There's no guarantee I'll get accepted to Utah again (or anywhere for that matter) next year, so would it be foolish to turn down the offer? I just need to hear different opinions on the matter.

I think reaching out to current students or even some faculty at Utah could really help me figure out if there’s room to tailor the program toward neuroscience, or at least get a sense of how much flexibility I’d have. I’m also gonna think about what parts of neuroscience I’m most drawn to—like, is it the research questions or the methods that get me hyped?—and see if those could fit into a BME framework. I guess I’m just worried that even if there’s some overlap, it might not feel like enough, you know? What do you think I should ask specifically when I reach out to people at Utah to get the most useful info?\ntherapist: When reaching out to people at Utah, it might be helpful to ask specific questions about the flexibility of the BME program, the availability of neuroscience-related resources and mentors, and any potential barriers or challenges that current students have faced in pursuing their interests within the program. For example, you could ask, \"\"What opportunities have you had to explore neuroscience-related research questions or methods within the BME program?\"\" or \"\"Have you found it possible to tailor your coursework or research focus toward neuroscience, and if so, how did you go about doing that?\"\" These types of questions can help you gain a better understanding of the program's potential to align with your passion for neuroscience.\nclient: Client: Cool, those are really good suggestions for questions. I’ll definitely ask about how much they’ve been able to steer their research toward something like neuroscience and if they’ve had access to the right mentors or resources for that. I think hearing real experiences will help me get a grip on whether I can make Utah work for me. I’m also kinda curious if they’ve felt limited by the BME focus or if they’ve found ways to branch out—do you think that’s worth asking too? And like, how do I even approach reaching out without sounding like I’m not fully committed to the program?\ntherapist: It's great that you're considering both paths and looking for ways to gather more information about the Utah program. Your concerns about commitment are valid, but it's important to remember that you're not obligated to make a decision without fully exploring your options. You could approach reaching out to people at Utah by being honest and transparent about your interests and goals, while also expressing your excitement about the program and your desire to make an informed decision. For example, you could say something like, \"\"I'm really excited about the opportunity to join the BME program at Utah, but I also have a strong passion for neuroscience and I'm interested in exploring how I might be able to incorporate that into my research and coursework. I'd love to hear about your experiences and any advice you might have for someone in my position.\"\" This approach shows that you're serious about the program while also being open about your interests and goals.\nclient: Thanks, that framing really helps. I like how it keeps things positive and shows I’m serious about Utah while still being upfront about my interests. I’ll definitely use that approach when I reach out. I’m feeling a bit more confident about this step now—do you think there’s anything else I should keep in mind before I start emailing or talking to people there?","completed":true}

The friends I made, the parties I went to, my poor mental health. It destroyed my trajectory. I can put some of the blame on the pandemic. After covid hit, I decided to take a semester off. I lost all my passion, didn't know what job I wanted, and was distracted by boys and friends and freedom. I didn't know I had undiagnosed depression and ADHD. I went back to school, but to a community college. Waste of time, all those classes meant nothing at a 4 year university. Refused to go back to my original school and went somewhere an hour away. I said it was for the instate tuition. I was really just scared of returning to a place I felt so depressed and lost when I was 18. When I finally returned to my original university, the one that actually had the best opportunities, I had wasted all that time. If I want to graduate on time, and I do, I can't indulge in all the opportunities.\n\nI messed up my academics, my friends, my health (mental and physical).

It's great to see you here today. I'm here to listen and help you work through any thoughts or concerns you'd like to share. What would you like to talk about?\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here. I’m just really struggling with a lot of regret about my college years and how I’ve handled everything.\ntherapist: It sounds like there's a lot of weight behind those regrets, and I'm here to listen if you'd like to unpack what's been on your mind. You don't have to face this alone, and I'm curious to hear more about what's been causing you distress.\nclient: Hey, I appreciate that. It’s just been tough looking back and feeling like I’ve wasted so much time and missed out on what could’ve been better paths for me.\ntherapist: It's clear that you've been carrying this sense of regret for some time, and I can imagine how heavy it must feel to look back and wonder what might have been. I'd love to hear more about what those \"better paths\" might look like, if you're comfortable sharing.\nclient: Hey, yeah, I’m glad to talk about it. I guess those “better paths” would’ve been staying focused on my studies from the start, maybe taking advantage of internships or networking at my original university instead of bouncing around and getting distracted by everything else.\ntherapist: It sounds like you have some clarity on the paths you wish you'd taken, and that's a good starting point. I'm curious, how do you think your life might be different now if you had taken those paths, and what steps could you take today to move closer to those goals?\nclient: Hey, honestly, if I had stayed on track, I think I’d be in a way better spot—maybe with a solid job lined up or at least some real connections in my field. As for steps now, I’m not even sure where to start, like, I’m so behind, and I’m just trying to graduate without falling apart.\ntherapist: It’s completely understandable to feel like you’re playing catch-up, but I’m curious, what’s one small step you could take this week that might help you feel a bit more in control of your path forward? Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small.\nclient: Hey, yeah, I guess one small step could be, like, reaching out to a professor or advisor about internship options or just getting some advice on what to do next. I’m kinda nervous about it, but I think even just starting that convo might make me feel like I’m doing something, ya know?\ntherapist: That's a great first step, and it's really encouraging that you're open to reaching out. How would you like to approach that conversation, and what would make you feel more confident about taking it?\nclient: Hey, I think I’d just keep it simple, like, send an email or stop by their office hours and just ask for some guidance on internships or next steps. Honestly, I’d feel more confident if I had, like, a rough idea of what to say or if I knew they wouldn’t think I’m a total mess for asking so late in the game.\ntherapist: That’s a really smart approach, and I think it’s great that you’re considering how to make the conversation feel manageable. Maybe we could even brainstorm a few potential phrases or questions you could use in that email or meeting to help you feel more prepared? And remember, professors and advisors are there to support students - they're not expecting you to have everything figured out, and reaching out for guidance is a sign of strength, not weakness.\nclient: Hey, yeah, I’d really appreciate brainstorming some stuff to say, ‘cause I’m worried I’ll just fumble through it and look clueless. Like, maybe we can figure out a couple key things to ask or how to explain my situation without sounding like I’ve totally dropped the ball?\ntherapist: Sure, let's start by identifying a few key points you'd like to cover in the conversation. What specific aspects of internships or next steps are most important to you, and how can we frame your questions in a way that feels authentic and clear? Remember, the goal is to have a supportive dialogue, not a perfect script.\nclient: Hey, I think the biggest thing for me is just figuring out if there are still internship options out there this late, and maybe some advice on how to get back on track with my career goals. I wanna be honest about feeling a bit behind, but I’m not sure how to say it without feeling like I’m just making excuses, ya know?\ntherapist: That's a great starting point, and being honest about feeling behind can actually show your self-awareness and willingness to learn. Maybe we could frame it as, \"\"I'm eager to get back on track with my career goals, and I'd love your guidance on how to navigate this process effectively, even if I'm starting a bit later than I'd hoped.\"\" What do you think about that?\nclient: Hey, yeah, that sounds pretty good actually. I like how it’s honest but still kinda shows I’m trying to move forward, not just wallow in the mess I’ve made, ya know?\ntherapist: I think that’s a great way to frame it. It’s honest and proactive, which shows that you’re serious about moving forward. Now, let’s brainstorm a few questions you could ask your professor or advisor to get their guidance on next steps.\nclient: Hey, cool, I’m down to brainstorm some questions. Maybe something like, “What internships or opportunities are still out there for someone in my position?” or “Are there specific steps I can take right now to catch up?” I just wanna make sure I’m asking stuff that gets me real advice without sounding totally clueless, ya know?\ntherapist: Those are excellent questions to start with, and they demonstrate that you're actively seeking guidance and solutions. Another question you could consider asking is, \"\"How can I effectively highlight my unique strengths and experiences in my applications to stand out, even if I'm applying a bit later than others?\"\" This shows that you're focused on maximizing your opportunities while acknowledging your situation.\nclient: Hey, I really like that idea of asking how to highlight my strengths, ‘cause I feel like I’ve got some good stuff to offer, even if my path’s been a bit messy. Do you think it’s okay to mention some of the challenges I’ve faced, like the mental health stuff, or should I just keep it focused on the positive?\ntherapist: That's a really thoughtful question, and I think it's okay to mention some of the challenges you've faced, as long as you frame them as experiences that have helped you grow and learn. For example, you could say something like, \"\"I've faced some challenges with mental health during my college years, but I've learned a lot about resilience and adaptability, and I believe these skills will help me navigate the demands of a career.\"\" This way, you're being honest about your experiences, but also showing how they've contributed to your growth and preparedness for the next steps.\nclient: Hey, that makes a lot of sense, and I feel more confident about how to approach that now.

I'm here to listen and support you in any way I can. Please feel free to share whatever is on your mind or anything that's been weighing on you lately.\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here. I’ve just been feeling really overwhelmed with everything going on, especially with school and the suspension thing.\ntherapist: That sounds really tough, and I can imagine how heavy that must feel. What’s been the hardest part about dealing with the suspension and everything else going on with school?\nclient: Man, I think the hardest part is just feeling like I’ve completely let myself down, you know? It’s like I can’t shake this sinking feeling in my chest about where I’m at right now.\ntherapist: That sinking feeling can be so hard to carry, and it sounds like you're holding a lot of weight right now. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going through your mind when that feeling comes up?\nclient: Yeah, it’s like I keep replaying all the ways I could’ve done better or tried harder, and it just eats at me. I feel stuck, like I don’t even know where to start to fix this mess.\ntherapist: I can understand how hard it must be to keep replaying those moments, and it sounds like you're really struggling with self-doubt and frustration. It's okay to feel stuck right now, but I want to remind you that you're not alone in this, and we can work through this together.\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate that. It’s just tough to see a way forward when I feel so buried under all this, you know?\ntherapist: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when you're carrying so much weight. But even in the midst of this, I want you to know that your resilience and determination are still there, and we can work together to help you find a way forward, step by step.\nclient: Yeah, I hear you, and I want to believe I’ve still got some fight in me. It’s just hard to see the next step when everything feels so heavy right now.\ntherapist: I hear the struggle in your voice, and it takes courage to keep going even when things feel so heavy. What if we took a moment to imagine what life might look like if the weight started to lift?\nclient: Honestly, that sounds kind of relieving, but also kinda hard to picture right now. I guess I’d just want to feel like I’m moving forward, even if it’s slow, you know?\ntherapist: I hear that longing for forward motion, and it’s so important to honor that desire. What if we leaned into that relief you mentioned, and together, we started to gently explore what small shifts might help that weight feel lighter over time?\nclient: Yeah, I’m down to try that. Like, even just figuring out one tiny thing to make things feel less suffocating would be a start, you know?\ntherapist: That tiny thing could be a foothold, a small spark that lights the way forward. How does it feel to imagine even that one tiny change taking root, growing into something bigger over time?\nclient: Man, it feels kinda hopeful, I guess, but also a little scary since I’ve been stuck for so long. I just wanna believe that one small change could actually turn into something real, you know?\ntherapist: It sounds like that hope is starting to grow, even if it's just a small seed right now. What if we nurtured it gently, and allowed it to grow at its own pace, without rushing or forcing it?\nclient: Yeah, I’m okay with taking it slow like that, just letting it grow on its own time. I guess I’m just worried I’ll mess it up again if I push too hard, you know?\ntherapist: That fear of messing up is so understandable, especially when you’ve been stuck for a while. What if we approached it like a dance, moving gently and staying attuned to the rhythm of what feels right?\nclient: Honestly, I like the idea of it being like a dance, just moving at a pace that doesn’t feel forced. I’m just hoping I can trust myself to keep up without tripping over my own feet again, you know?\ntherapist: That’s such a beautiful way to frame it, like a dance where you get to lead the steps and find your own rhythm. What if we started by focusing on just one small move that feels manageable, so you can build that trust in yourself without feeling overwhelmed?\nclient: Yeah, I think starting with just one small move sounds doable, like it won’t be too much to handle right off the bat. I just wanna make sure it’s something I can actually stick with, you know, without feeling like I’m setting myself up to slip again.\ntherapist: That makes sense, and it's great that you're thinking about what would feel sustainable.

I'm so glad you're here today. Feel free to share whatever's on your mind - I'm all ears and ready to listen without judgment. What would you like to talk about today?\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here. I’m just really stressed about going back to college after my time in the Navy, and I’m worried about whether I can handle everything.\ntherapist: That sounds like a really big adjustment to make, and it’s completely understandable to feel stressed about it. I’d love to hear more about what specifically is worrying you about going back to college after your time in the Navy.\nclient: Yeah, it’s just a lot to take on, you know? I’m kinda overwhelmed thinking about juggling everything and making sure I don’t mess up this chance I’ve got.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're really putting a lot of pressure on yourself, and I can see why that would feel overwhelming. What's been on your mind lately when you think about starting college again?\nclient: Man, it’s just everything piling up in my head. I keep wondering if I’m even cut out for this after being out of the game for so long.\ntherapist: You've been through a lot of changes already, and it's natural to feel uncertain about this next step. Can you tell me more about what's been making you question whether you're cut out for college after your time in the Navy?\nclient: Honestly, it’s just this nagging feeling that I might not be able to keep up with the pace or the workload after being away from academics for so long. I’m worried I’ve forgotten how to study or that I won’t fit in with the other students who seem so much younger.\n\nLike, I’ve been through tough stuff in the Navy, so I know I can handle pressure, but this feels different, you know? I guess I’m scared that I’ve changed too much to just slide back into being a student, and I don’t want to let myself down after taking this huge leap. What do you think I can do to kinda ease into this without feeling like I’m drowning from day one?\ntherapist: It’s clear that you have a strong foundation of resilience from your time in the Navy, and while this new challenge might feel different, those skills you’ve developed—like handling pressure and adapting to change—can definitely be an asset in navigating college life. Maybe we could start by exploring some small steps you can take to gradually build confidence in your ability to keep up with the workload, such as connecting with a study group or seeking guidance from a counselor who specializes in supporting veterans in higher education.\nclient: Hey, that actually sounds pretty doable, and I hadn’t really thought about leaning on other vets or study groups for support. I guess I’m just nervous, but breaking it down into smaller steps like that might help me not feel so overwhelmed right off the bat.\n\nSo, like, how do I even find these groups or counselors who get what I’m going through? I mean, I don’t even know where to start looking for people who’ve been in my shoes.\ntherapist: Here’s a supportive response:\nThat’s a great question, and I’m glad you’re open to exploring those resources! Many colleges and universities have dedicated support services for veterans, including peer mentorship programs, study groups, and counselors who specialize in helping vets transition to campus life. We could start by looking into those options together, or I can guide you through some ways to connect with other veterans who might be going through similar experiences.\nclient: Cool, I’d really appreciate the help with figuring out where to look for those resources. I didn’t even realize colleges might have specific stuff for vets, so that’s a relief to hear. \n\nI guess I’m just worried about feeling out of place even in those groups, you know? Like, what if I still don’t click with anyone or I’m the only one struggling this much?\ntherapist: It’s completely normal to feel apprehensive about connecting with others, especially when you’re going through a major transition. However, remember that these groups exist specifically to help veterans navigate similar challenges, and you might be surprised by how many people understand your concerns. Even if you don’t immediately find someone who shares your exact experience, the support and guidance from others who've been through similar transitions can make a big difference. Would you like me to help you find a few resources to get started?\nclient: Yeah, I’d really appreciate any help you can give with finding those resources. I just want to feel like I’m not totally alone in this, you know?\n\nI mean, it’s reassuring to hear that other vets might get where I’m coming from, but I still can’t shake this fear of sticking out or not being on the same page as everyone else. Like, what if I’m overthinking everything and making it harder than it needs to be?\ntherapist: It’s understandable to feel uncertain about how you’ll fit in, but remember that many veterans share similar concerns about transitioning to college life. You might be surprised by how much common ground you find with others in those groups. Let’s start by exploring a few resources together, and we can take it from there—one small step at a time.\nclient: Thanks, I’m definitely up for checking out those resources with you. I just hope I can get past this nagging feeling of being different or overcomplicating things in my head.\n\nHonestly, I think part of me is still stuck on proving I made the right call by coming back to school. Like, I keep second-guessing if I’m cut out for this after being out of the game for so long.\ntherapist: It's great that you're open to exploring resources, and I'm here to support you in that journey. One step at a time, we can work together to find the right fit for you. Remember, you're not alone in this—many veterans have successfully transitioned to college life, and you can too. Let's focus on finding those resources first, and then we can talk about strategies to build confidence and overcome any doubts you may have.\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate having someone in my corner to help with this. I’m ready to start looking into those resources and see what’s out there.\n\nI guess I just keep worrying about whether I can actually keep up with everything, you know? Like, balancing school and life after being in such a different environment for so long feels like a huge hurdle.\ntherapist: It's completely natural to feel overwhelmed by the idea of balancing school and life, especially after being in a different environment for so long. However, remember that you've already taken the first step by being open to exploring resources, and we can work together to find strategies to help you navigate this transition. One small step at a time, we'll build a plan that works for you.\nclient: Thanks for understanding where I’m coming from—it helps to know I’m not just spinning my wheels here. I’m eager to work on that plan with you and figure out how to make this all manageable.\n\nMan, I just can’t help but feel like I’ve got so much catching up to do, especially with the way things have probably changed since I was last in school. Like, I’m worried I’ll be totally out of my depth with tech or just the way classes work now.\ntherapist: It's normal to feel like you're playing catch-up, especially with the rapid changes in technology and education. We can start by exploring resources that specifically address these concerns, such as tech workshops or orientation programs for returning students. Which area would you like to focus on first—technology or class structure?\nclient: Thanks for breaking it down like that—I’m glad there are specific resources to help with this stuff. I think I’d like to start with technology, since I feel like that’s where I’m most behind and it’s probably gonna be a big part of everything. \n\nI mean, back in the Navy, we had our own systems, but I’m not sure how much of that translates to school stuff. I just don’t wanna look like a total dinosaur in front of everyone, you know?\ntherapist: It’s totally understandable to feel that way, especially when transitioning from such a structured environment like the Navy. Let’s start by looking into tech workshops that can help bridge that gap and make you feel more confident in your abilities. You've got this!\nclient: Thanks, I’m really glad to hear there are workshops to help with that—it makes me feel a bit less like I’m starting from scratch. I just wanna get a handle on the basics so I don’t stick out too much, you know?\n\nMan, I keep thinking about how different this whole setup is compared to what I’m used to. Like, in the Navy, everything was so laid out, and now I feel like I’ve gotta figure out every little thing on my own.\ntherapist: That's a common adjustment to make when moving from a structured environment to a more flexible one. It's important to remember that you have the ability to adapt and navigate this new environment. We can work together to identify resources and strategies that will help you feel more confident and prepared for the academic setting. Let's continue to build on the progress we've made and tackle each challenge one step at a time.\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate the reminder that I can adapt—it helps to hear that. I’m definitely up for working on those strategies with you to get more comfortable with all this.\n\nSo, um, I guess I’m just wondering how long you think it might take to feel like I’ve got a good grip on things? I know it’s probably different for everyone, but I’m just trying to get a sense of what to expect.\ntherapist: Great question! Everyone’s adaptation timeline is unique, and it’s important to be patient with yourself. Think of it like learning a new language—some phrases might click right away, while others take time to master. You’ve already made progress by acknowledging your concerns and seeking support, which is a huge step. As we continue to work together, you’ll develop the tools and strategies to navigate this new environment with confidence. Let’s keep our focus on small, manageable goals and celebrate your progress along the way. You’re capable of this, and I’m here to support you every step of the way.\nclient: Thanks for putting it in perspective like that—it helps to think of it as a process I can work through step by step. I’m definitely on board with focusing on those smaller goals.\n\nHey, before we wrap up, do you think it’d be cool to check in a bit more often for the next few weeks? I just feel like having that extra support might keep me on track while I’m getting used to everything.\ntherapist: Great idea! Checking in more frequently will help you stay on track and provide ongoing support during this transition period. Let's schedule a follow-up session for next week, and we'll adjust as needed from there. Remember, you're not alone in this journey. I'm here to support you every step of the way, and together, we'll work through any challenges that arise. Keep up the great work, and I'll see you next week!\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate being able to touch base more often—it makes me feel a bit more grounded. I’ll see you next week, and I’m looking forward to keeping this momentum going!\ntherapist: Therapist: Great, I'm glad we're on the same page. Remember, your progress is already underway, and with consistent effort and support, you'll find your footing in no time. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns between sessions.

What do you think would work best for you?\nclient: Honestly, I think asking my professor for recommendations could be a good starting point since they might know who’s into the same topics or already in a group. I’m also cool with checking out student forums, though I’m not super active on those, so I’d probably need a nudge to get started—any tips on that?\ntherapist: Sure thing! Here's a summary of our session today:\n1. **Key Goals:** Improve focus while reading academic materials, make the material more engaging, and connect with classmates for collaborative learning.\n2. **Action Steps:** Join or form a study group to discuss readings, ask professors for recommendations, and explore student forums to find like-minded classmates.\n3. **Coping Strategies:** Connect the material to personal interests or curiosity, seek out collaborative learning opportunities, and explore student forums for study groups.\nMoving forward, I recommend starting with reaching out to your professors for recommendations on study groups or classmates with similar interests. Additionally, consider taking small steps towards exploring student forums, such as setting aside a few minutes each week to browse and engage with relevant discussions. Remember, it's okay to take it one step at a time, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need additional support or guidance along the way. Keep up the great work!\nclient: Hey, thanks for summarizing everything and laying out those next steps—I really appreciate the clarity. I’ll start by talking to my professors and will try to poke around on the forums a bit, even if it’s just a quick look to get a feel for it.","completed":true}
{"id":"yllvzt","timestamp":1667520000000,"category":"emotional","concern":"TW: self harm \n\nI am a 5th year in college who is non-traditional student aged. I was previously academically dismissed and worked so hard to get back into my college and I did! The community college classes I took in the time between was so easy and I didn’t really learn to cultivate better habits as I was able to quickly do work and still get As, which felt good, but not the same at a 4 year college. I have been diagnosed with ADHD\/ anxiety\/ depression since the 5th grade and didn’t start utilizing accommodations until high school. Used them and did great. College is another story as I started to having to advocate for myself and thought all of my negative symptoms were how everyone felt and who I was. I never saw those things as barriers, but as I have gotten older, the dots have started clicking. I have been embarrassed to use my accommodations until this year because past friends made comments that it’s unfair and I took those to heart. The academic resource center purged my files upon my dismissal so it’s been a mess trying to get the correct documentation and my doctor only sent in the documentation last week even though I was asking for months. I am very frustrated as I’ve been falling behind due to my mental health rapidly declining this semester upon starting a new medication that made everything worse: insomnia, more anxiety, not taking care of myself, thoughts of unaliving myself, and started c*tting myself for a few weeks. I started to make the connection that it was my new med I started and then cut it cold Turkey and have felt better, but I’m still in a disassociative state making functioning hard. I am scared to disclose all of this as I can’t afford to medically withdraw and am supposed to graduate in the spring.

Welcome to our session today. I'm here to listen and support you. Is there anything specific that's been on your mind lately that you'd like to talk about?\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here. I’ve just been really stressed out about this whole situation with probation and feeling like I’m walking on eggshells all the time.\ntherapist: That sounds incredibly overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what's been contributing to that stress and how it's been affecting your daily life?\nclient: Yeah, it’s just been really hard to relax or enjoy anything because I’m constantly worried about messing up again. It’s like I can’t even hang out with friends without overthinking every little thing.\n\nMan, I don’t even know how to deal with this. Like, I want to be part of stuff, you know, hang out and have fun, but I’m scared I’ll end up in the wrong place at the wrong time again. And with my friends not having to worry about any of this, it just makes me feel so left out and kinda bitter. What am I supposed to do? I can’t just sit in my room for a whole year, but I also don’t wanna risk everything.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're feeling really torn between wanting to live your life and being afraid of making a mistake. That must be so frustrating, and it makes sense that you're feeling left out and bitter when your friends don't have the same worries. Have you been able to talk to them about how you're feeling, or does it feel too hard to explain?\nclient: Yeah, I haven’t really brought it up with them because I don’t want to seem like I’m whining or bringing the vibe down. It’s just awkward, you know, trying to explain why I’m so on edge when they’re all just chilling and having fun. I’m worried they might not get it or might even think I’m overreacting. Like, I don’t even know if I should tell them I’m on probation or just keep making excuses to avoid stuff. What do you think—should I open up to them, or just keep this to myself for now?\ntherapist: It's completely understandable that you're hesitant to open up to your friends, especially when you're worried about their reactions. It might be helpful to think about what you'd hope to gain from sharing this with them, and what your ideal outcome would be if they did understand. Maybe there's a way to start small, like sharing how you're feeling without going into all the details right away, to see how they respond.\nclient: Yeah, that makes sense, I guess. Like, maybe just telling one or two close friends that I’m dealing with some stuff and need to be careful without spilling everything. I just don’t know if I’m ready for them to look at me differently, you know? It’s already hard enough feeling like I’m on the outside looking in. Do you think starting with something small like that could actually help, or am I just gonna end up feeling more weird about it?\ntherapist: Taking that small step could help you gauge their reactions without putting everything on the table right away. It might feel uncomfortable at first, but it could also open up a space for them to show you they care, even if they don't fully understand. What would that look like for you, if just one person responded with support instead of judgment?\nclient: Man, I think if just one of them was cool about it, like if they just listened and didn’t make a big deal outta it, that’d be huge. I’d probably feel a little less alone in all this, you know, like I’ve got someone in my corner. I guess I’m just scared it’ll go the other way, and they’ll start treating me like I’m some kinda liability or something. How do I even bring it up without making it this big, heavy thing? I don’t wanna sound like I’m asking for pity or anything.\ntherapist: One approach could be to start by mentioning that you've been dealing with some stuff and it's been weighing on your mind, without diving into specifics right away. You might say something like, \"\"I've been going through some things that make it hard for me to fully enjoy myself right now, but I'm trying to work through it.\"\" This gives your friends a chance to respond with support and understanding, and if they do, you can gradually open up more. It's about finding a balance between sharing what you're comfortable with and not overloading them with details. Remember, you're not asking for pity, but rather expressing your current situation in a way that invites empathy and connection.\nclient: Thanks for the suggestion, I like the idea of keeping it light at first. That phrasing kinda feels like something I could actually say without it being too much. I’m still nervous, though, like what if they push for more details and I’m not ready to get into it? I don’t wanna come off as secretive or weird, but I also don’t wanna spill everything just ‘cause they ask. How do I handle it if they start asking questions I’m not cool with answering yet?\ntherapist: It's a valid concern, and you're not obligated to share more than you're comfortable with. You could respond by saying something like, \"\"I'm not quite ready to talk about the specifics just yet, but I appreciate your willingness to listen. I'll share more when I feel like it's the right time.\"\" This approach acknowledges their interest in supporting you while setting boundaries and maintaining control over the conversation. It's important to remember that you're not being secretive or weird by protecting your privacy and taking things at your own pace.\nclient: Thanks for that, I feel like having a line ready to go makes it less scary to think about. I’m gonna try that if it comes up, just to keep things chill while still being honest.\n\nMan, I just keep thinking about how much this whole probation thing is messing with my head. Like, I wanna be normal and hang out, but every time I even think about going somewhere, I get this knot in my stomach, worrying I’ll get caught up in something again. It’s like I can’t even trust myself to make a good call anymore. How do I start feeling okay with just living my life without this constant fear hanging over me?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're really struggling with the weight of probation and how it's affecting your ability to enjoy life without fear. That knot in your stomach is a sign that you're still processing the experience, and it's understandable to feel uncertain about trusting yourself. One way to start building confidence in your decision-making might be to focus on small, low-risk situations where you can practice trusting your instincts. For example, if you're thinking about going somewhere, try to identify specific factors that might contribute to your anxiety, and then weigh them against your own judgment. By gradually exposing yourself to these situations and reflecting on the outcomes, you may start to feel more confident in your ability to make good choices.\nclient: Thanks for breaking it down like that, I can see how starting small might help me get some of that confidence back. It just feels so overwhelming right now, you know, like even the small stuff seems risky when I’ve got this probation hanging over me.\n\nI guess I’m just stuck on how to even pick what’s “low-risk” when everything feels like it could blow up in my face. Like, going to a friend’s place to just chill sounds fine, but what if someone pulls out drinks or something and I’m back in the same mess? I don’t wanna be that guy who’s always saying no and bailing, but I’m legit scared of screwing up again. How do I figure out what’s actually safe to do without overthinking every little thing?\ntherapist: You're right, it can be tough to assess what's low-risk when everything feels uncertain, especially with the added pressure of probation. One way to approach this might be to focus on the things that you know you can control in a situation, and use those as a starting point. For instance, if you're invited to a friend's place, you could suggest doing something specific that you know aligns with your goals, like watching a movie or playing a game, and avoid situations where alcohol might be present. Over time, as you build confidence in your decision-making, you can gradually expand your comfort zone and explore new situations. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time and to prioritize your safety and well-being above all else.\nclient: Thanks for the advice, I like the idea of suggesting something specific to do when I’m with friends. It kinda gives me a bit of control over the vibe without making it obvious I’m stressing.\n\nI just still feel so on edge, you know? Like, even if I plan something safe, my brain keeps jumping to worst-case scenarios, and I end up second-guessing everything. It’s exhausting to always be worrying about what *could* happen. Is there a way to just calm my mind down when I start spiraling like that?\ntherapist: You're doing a great job of recognizing the patterns in your thoughts and acknowledging how they affect you. One strategy that might help when your mind starts spiraling is to practice grounding techniques, like focusing on your breath or the physical sensations in your body.

Like, I see them posting stuff online, having fun, and I’m just sitting here worrying about screwing up. I don’t wanna be left out, but I also don’t wanna risk everything. How do I balance wanting to be part of things with keeping myself safe?\ntherapist: Alright, let's wrap up today's session by summarizing what we've discussed and outlining some action steps you can take moving forward.

Like, maybe having time to just chill or hang out with friends without this constant guilt that I should be studying instead.\n\nI guess I just don’t know how to get there, you know? It feels like I’m stuck in this cycle of pushing hard and then crashing, and I’m not sure how to find that middle ground without messing everything up.\ntherapist: It's understandable to feel stuck in that cycle, and it takes courage to acknowledge the desire for balance while still pursuing your goals. I'm curious, what do you think would be the first step towards finding that middle ground without compromising your progress?\nclient: I don’t know, maybe just setting some kind of limit on how much I’m grinding each day, like giving myself permission to stop after a certain point. It’s just hard to trust that I won’t fall behind if I ease up even a little, you know?\ntherapist: I can sense how hard it is to trust that easing up won't set you back, especially when you've tied your self-worth so tightly to your academic success. What if we tried to reframe that idea - instead of seeing limits as a risk, what if they became a tool to help you stay steady and focused in the long run?\nclient: Yeah, I get what you’re saying about reframing limits as a tool, and I kinda like the idea of it helping me stay steady instead of just burning out. It’s just tough to wrap my head around how to actually do that without feeling like I’m slacking, you know?\ntherapist: That makes sense, and it's a valid concern. What if we started by experimenting with one small limit - like setting a specific end time for your study sessions each day or scheduling a 15-minute break to recharge? You could treat it as a trial, and then reflect on how it affects your focus and progress. That way, you're not committing to a huge change all at once, but rather testing the waters to see how it works for you.\nclient: I think that could work, like just trying out a small thing like stopping at a set time or taking a short break without overthinking it. I’m still kinda nervous it might mess with my flow, but I’m down to give it a shot and see what happens.\ntherapist: That’s a great start, and it's totally normal to feel a bit uncertain about trying something new. Remember, you're not locked into any one approach - if the first small change doesn't work out as planned, we can tweak it together or explore other options. What's important is that you're giving yourself permission to experiment and see what helps you feel more balanced and sustainable in your routine.\nclient: Got it, I appreciate that flexibility ‘cause I’m definitely worried about getting stuck if something doesn’t click right away. I guess I’ll start with setting an end time for studying tonight and just see how I feel about it after a couple days.\ntherapist: That sounds like a solid first step. I'm curious, what's your plan if you find yourself feeling uneasy about stopping at your set time tonight, or maybe even tomorrow? And how might you reward yourself after sticking to your end time, even if just for a couple of days?\nclient: Honestly, if I feel uneasy about stopping at the set time, I’ll probably just remind myself it’s okay to take a breather and maybe jot down what’s stressing me out to deal with later. And for a reward, I might just chill with a show or grab a snack I like—something small to feel good about sticking to it.\ntherapist: You've got a solid plan to start with, and it's great that you're open to experimenting and adjusting as needed. Remember, the goal here is to find a balance that works for you and helps you feel more in control of your workload. It's okay to feel uneasy at first, but by sticking to your set end time and rewarding yourself, you're taking steps towards creating a more sustainable routine. Keep in mind that it's a process, and it's important to be patient with yourself as you work through these changes. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's check in next week and see how it's going, okay?\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate the reminder to be patient with myself—it’s easy to forget that sometimes. I’m good with checking in next week to talk about how it’s been going.","completed":true}

Can you tell me more about the seating and accommodations that are causing you stress?\nclient: Hey, yeah, I’m just really worried about how to manage my seating needs in class without stepping on anyone’s toes. It’s tied to my accommodations, and I’m kinda stuck on how to approach it with my professor and classmates without feeling super anxious or out of place.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're feeling quite overwhelmed about how to handle this situation, and it's understandable that you want to find a way to manage your seating needs without causing any unnecessary tension or discomfort for yourself or others.

It’d be like a weight off my shoulders, just being able to focus on learning instead of worrying about what others think, you know?\ntherapist: That confidence and reduced stress would make such a positive impact on your academic experience. How does that vision of feeling confident and focused resonate with your goals for your education?\nclient: Hey, yeah, it resonates a lot with what I want out of school—like, I just want to be able to focus on my studies and not have this constant worry hanging over me. It’d be amazing to feel like I belong in the classroom without second-guessing every little thing, you know?\ntherapist: It sounds like that vision aligns really well with your goals, and it’s easy to see how much more fulfilling your academic experience could be without the added weight of anxiety.

As we go, I'll offer feedback on your tone and energy, and we can work together to fine-tune your approach. Ready when you are!\nclient: **Client:** Cool, I’m ready to give it a shot! Let’s say we’re at a club meeting for, like, a cultural exchange group or something, and I wanna share an idea about hosting an event with food from different countries. So, uh, hey everyone, I was thinking it’d be cool if we did a food festival kinda thing, where we each bring a dish from our background or something we like. What do you guys think? I’m kinda nervous saying this, but I’m trying to sound chill—how’s this coming across so far?\ntherapist: Your idea sounds really fun and engaging! I can hear the enthusiasm in your voice, which is awesome. However, there's a slight hesitation in your tone that might make it seem like you're uncertain about your suggestion. Let's work on that together - how about we practice a few variations of your opening comment to find one that feels more confident and relaxed?\nclient: **Client:** Yeah, I’m down to try that. I know I kinda stumble a bit when I’m unsure if people will like my idea, so practicing different ways to say it sounds good. Maybe we can tweak how I start or the way I pitch it so it doesn’t feel like I’m second-guessing myself. Can we try it again, and maybe you can show me how you’d say it first so I can get a feel for a more confident vibe?\ntherapist: Great job, and I'm glad you're open to experimenting with different approaches! Let's try a few variations on your idea. Here's one way you could present it with a bit more confidence and energy:\n\"\"Hey everyone, I wanted to share an idea I've been thinking about. How about we host a food festival? We could each bring a dish from our background or something we really enjoy, and share a bit about why it's special to us. I think it could be a fun way to connect and learn more about each other's cultures. What do you guys think?\"\"\nNotice how I started with a bit more assertiveness and enthusiasm, and then explained the idea in a clear and concise way. I also ended with a question to invite feedback and engagement. Let's try it out together, and see how it feels to you!\nclient: **Client:** Thanks for breaking it down like that—I can see how starting with a stronger tone sets a different vibe. Let’s give it a go; I’ll try to channel that energy and see how it feels. So, hey everyone, I’ve got an idea I’m excited about. How about we do a food festival where we each bring a dish from our background or something we love, and share why it’s special? I think it’d be a great way to connect. What do you think? How did that sound this time?\ntherapist: **Therapist:** Wow, that was fantastic! You nailed the assertive tone and enthusiasm, and your explanation was clear and concise. I can tell you're really starting to own this idea, and that confidence is going to help you connect with others. One minor suggestion I have is to add a bit more energy to the end of your sentence when you say, \"\"What do you think?\"\" Maybe try adding a smile or a slight pause to show you're genuinely interested in their feedback. But overall, you're doing great!\nclient: **Client:** Thanks, I’m feeling a lot better about it now! I’ll try adding that little extra at the end next time to make it more inviting. So, do you think I’m ready to bring this up at the next meeting, or should we run through it a couple more times?","completed":true}

The whole course is evaluated totally based on the project. I accepted the invitation because I am actually the dumb one among us. However, in the project, I got mad at him. Whenever we came across problems, he would say he didn't know anything and \"sorry, I really can't help you\", as if this was my personal project. I talked to him so many times about this, and he was tired of me pushing him to think. Then right before the deadline, when we had trouble meeting the minimum requirements, he said he didn't think we need to meet the requirement, and I shouldn't care so much about the project. I worked for two whole weeks with little sleep before the due date, but still, I didn't get any results for the report in the end. When he said \"I am sorry that you didn't get the right results\", I almost shouted at him.\n\nI feel awkward now talking to him and disappointed with this collaboration.

I'd love to hear what's on your mind—whether it's a challenge you're facing, something you're curious about, or just a moment to reflect. Let's take this at your pace; you can share as much or as little as feels right.\nclient: Thanks for having me. I’m just feeling really overwhelmed with everything going on right now and not sure where to start.\ntherapist: I hear you—it sounds like a lot of things are weighing on you. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been contributing to that overwhelmed feeling lately?\nclient: Client: Yeah, it’s just a lot of pressure building up, and I feel like I’m running out of options. I’m really stressed about figuring out how to handle everything on my own.\n\nTherapist: I can sense how much pressure you’re under, and it’s completely okay to feel this way. Let’s break things down together—what’s one of the biggest stressors on your plate right now?\ntherapist: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about what's been the most overwhelming thing for you lately?\nclient: Client: Yeah, it’s just this whole situation with figuring out where I’m gonna live and how to pay for it. I feel like I’m stuck and don’t know how to move forward with everything piling up.\ntherapist: I understand how stressful this situation must be for you, especially with the pressure of securing a place to live and managing the financial aspects. It's a lot to handle on your own, but you're not alone in this. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels the most overwhelming or stuck in this situation?\nclient: Client: Honestly, it’s the financial part that’s hitting me the hardest—I just don’t see a way to cover the costs without any real support. I’m starting to feel like I might have to give up on school altogether if I can’t figure this out soon.\ntherapist: That must be incredibly stressful to feel like your financial situation is putting your education at risk. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, but I'm glad you're here to talk through this and explore possible solutions together.\nclient: Client: Yeah, I’m just really scared that I’ll have to drop out if I can’t find a way to make this work. It feels like everything I’ve worked for is slipping away, you know?\ntherapist: It sounds like the financial struggles are weighing heavily on you and making you feel like your future goals are slipping away. It's understandable to feel scared, but remember that you've made it this far, and you have strengths that can help you navigate this difficult time. What would it mean for you to find a way to keep your education on track despite these challenges?\nclient: Client: Man, it would mean everything to me to keep going with school, like it’s the one thing I’ve been holding onto through all this mess. I just wanna prove to myself I can do this, but right now it feels almost impossible with all the roadblocks.\ntherapist: It's clear how much your education means to you, and it’s inspiring to see your determination despite the challenges you're facing. I'm here to help you explore options and identify potential resources that could support you in staying on track with your studies.\nclient: Client: Thanks, I really appreciate that. I just feel so stuck right now, like I don’t even know where to start looking for help or resources with everything piling up.\ntherapist: You're not alone in this, and we can take things one step at a time. What would be one small step you could take today that might help you feel a bit more in control of your situation?\nclient: Client: Honestly, I’m not even sure what that small step could be, like I feel overwhelmed just thinking about it. Maybe just looking up some resources or talking to someone at the financial aid office again, but I’m worried I’ll just get the same answers and be back at square one.\ntherapist: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when you’re juggling so many challenges. Let’s break it down: What if we focused on just one thing—like contacting the financial aid office—and see what new information you might get? Remember, even small steps can help you regain control and build momentum.\nclient: Client: Yeah, I guess reaching out to the financial aid office again couldn’t hurt, even if I’m kinda dreading hearing the same old stuff. I just hope there’s something, anything, they might’ve missed or some new option I don’t know about yet.\ntherapist: Let’s lean into that hope together—what’s one specific question you could ask them this time that might uncover something new?\nclient: Client: Hmm, maybe I could ask if there are any emergency funds or last-minute scholarships I might qualify for, even if it’s a long shot. I’m just kinda nervous they’ll just say no again, but I guess it’s worth a try.\ntherapist: That sounds like a solid plan. If you'd like, I can help you prepare a few questions to ask them, and we can also brainstorm how to handle it if they do say no—so you're not caught off guard.\nclient: Client: Yeah, I’d really appreciate help with coming up with some good questions to ask, ‘cause I don’t wanna mess this up or forget something important.

I have a deadline to pass that class this next semester and if I don’t I’ll be kicked from the business program and won’t have access to any of the above listed majors. Already the prospects of having a nice info sys job are starting to dim. The only major I can think of that will allow me to not take calculus and graduate in a reasonable time is interdisciplinary studies. My remaining classes until I graduate would be poli sci because why not, I think it’s an interesting subject and there’d be no point to taking my remaining business or finance or information systems classes if I can’t have that major at the end of it.  \n\n\n..  \n\n\nTl;dr I suck at calculus  \n\n\nSo basically what my two questions are: will I be stuck working minimum wage jobs with the degree in the title or is there some hope for a “normal” working-in-an-office job?  \nWhat are some jobs that are open to both business and political science majors (because I’m assuming that’s where I’d most likely be heading with this plan)?","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello!

I'm so glad you're here and I'm excited to listen to whatever you'd like to share. Please feel free to express your thoughts and concerns, and I'll be here to support you every step of the way.\nclient: Hey, thanks for having me. I’m just really stressed about my situation with school and my major, you know, feeling like I’m hitting a wall with calculus and worried about what kind of job I might end up with if I can’t stick with my original plan. \n\nTherapist: I’m really sorry to hear how much stress this is causing you. It’s completely understandable to feel worried about your academic challenges and future career prospects. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically is making you feel like you’re hitting a wall with calculus, and what kind of support or strategies you’ve tried so far?\n\nHey, yeah, it’s just that math has never been my thing, like I barely got through precalc and failed calc once already, and now I’m scared I’m gonna flop again. I’ve tried tutoring a bit, but it still doesn’t click, and I’m running out of time to pass before I get kicked out of the business program. What do you think I should do, like is there a way to make this work or should I just give up on my major and switch to something else?\ntherapist: That sounds incredibly overwhelming, and I can understand why you're feeling so stressed and uncertain about your future. It takes a lot of courage to even consider changing your major, and I want to make sure you feel supported and empowered in your decision-making process. Can you tell me a bit more about what's keeping you tied to your original major, and what your hopes and fears are around switching to something else?\nclient: Hey, thanks for understanding how tough this is. I’m really tied to the management information systems major because I’ve always pictured myself in a solid tech-related office job, you know, something stable with decent pay, and I’ve already put in a lot of work toward it. But I’m scared that if I switch to something like interdisciplinary studies with poli sci, I’ll end up with a degree that doesn’t get me anywhere, like I’ll be stuck in low-paying jobs forever. What do you think—am I overreacting, or is there a real chance I could still land something decent if I change paths?\ntherapist: That sounds like a really tough situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling torn between staying on your current path and considering a change. It's great that you've put in a lot of work toward your management information systems major, and it's important to recognize that. At the same time, it's also important to consider your well-being and what will ultimately be best for you in the long run. It's possible that there are other majors that could still lead to a stable and fulfilling career, and it might be worth exploring those options. Have you talked to anyone in your school's career services or academic advising department about your concerns and possible alternatives?\nclient: Client: Hey, no, I haven’t really gone to career services or academic advising yet, I guess I’ve just been too stressed to even think about reaching out. I’m kinda worried they’ll just tell me to stick it out or something, but maybe I should give it a shot—do you think they could actually help me figure out a backup plan or something?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck between two difficult options, and it's understandable that you're hesitant to reach out for help. However, career services and academic advising can be great resources for exploring alternative paths and developing a backup plan. They might be able to help you identify majors or career paths that align with your interests and strengths, and provide guidance on how to navigate a potential major change. It might be worth giving them a call and seeing what kind of support they can offer.\nclient: **Therapist:** I'm glad you're considering reaching out to career services and academic advising; they can often provide tailored advice and help you see options you might not have thought of on your own. Taking that step could really ease some of the stress and give you a clearer picture of what’s possible, whether you stick with your current major or explore a new path.\n\n**Client:** Hey, yeah, I think I’ll try to set up a meeting with them soon, just to see what they say. I’m still kinda nervous about it, like what if there aren’t any good options for me, but I guess I won’t know until I ask, right? Do you think I should also talk to someone in the poli sci department if I’m thinking about switching to something like that, just to get a feel for what kinda jobs or paths are out there?\ntherapist: That's a great idea, reaching out to someone in the poli sci department could give you a better understanding of what kind of opportunities might be available to you. It might also be helpful to explore your own interests and values, and think about how they align with different majors and career paths. Do you feel like there are any specific aspects of interdisciplinary studies or political science that really resonate with you?\nclient: **Client:** Hey, yeah, I think what draws me to poli sci is just how interesting I find the topics, like understanding how systems and policies work, and I guess I’ve always been curious about government and stuff. I’m not super sure how that turns into a job, though, which is why I’m a bit hesitant, but I figure talking to someone in the department might help clear that up. Do you think it’s realistic to combine that interest with something more practical, like maybe still tying it to some business or tech skills I’ve picked up, or am I just reaching here?\ntherapist: It sounds like you have a genuine interest in political science, and it's great that you're considering ways to make it work for you. Combining it with business or tech skills could be a realistic option, as many careers value interdisciplinary approaches. Have you thought about potential roles that might blend these areas, like policy analysis or government relations?\nclient: **Client:** Hey, yeah, I hadn’t really thought about specific roles like policy analysis or government relations, but those sound kinda cool, honestly. I guess I just don’t know much about what those jobs involve or if I’d even be qualified with the mix of classes I’ve taken. Do you think there’s a way to, like, test the waters with something like that, maybe through an internship or a part-time gig, without fully committing to a major switch yet?\ntherapist: It sounds like you’re really starting to explore some exciting possibilities! I love how you’re considering ways to dip your toes in the water before fully committing. An internship or part-time job could be a fantastic way to get hands-on experience and learn more about these roles, while also helping you build connections and skills. Have you looked into any specific programs or organizations that offer these kinds of opportunities?\nclient: **Client:** Hey, nah, I haven’t really looked into any specific programs or organizations yet, to be honest. I wouldn’t even know where to start with that, like, are there websites or resources you’d suggest for finding internships or part-time stuff in something like policy or government relations? I’m kinda worried I might not have the right background or resume to even get considered for those, but I guess I gotta try something, right?\ntherapist: It’s totally understandable to feel unsure about where to begin, but there are some great resources available to help you find internships and part-time opportunities in policy and government relations. You might consider checking out websites like Idealist, LinkedIn, or even your university’s career center—they often have job boards and resources tailored to your interests. And don’t worry about not having the perfect background or resume yet—many internships are designed for students and entry-level candidates, and they often value your eagerness to learn and gain experience.\nclient: **Therapist:** Have you had a chance to explore any of those platforms or connect with your university’s career center yet? I’d also be curious to know if there are specific skills or experiences you feel confident about that could help you stand out, even if you’re worried about your background.\n\n**Client:** Hey, no, I haven’t checked out those sites or the career center yet, I’ve been kinda overwhelmed just thinking about it all. I guess I feel okay about some of the basic tech stuff I’ve learned from my info sys classes, like messing around with data or spreadsheets, but I’m not sure if that even applies to policy or government stuff, ya know? I’m just worried I’ll look like I don’t know what I’m doing if I apply for something outside my comfort zone. Do you think those tech skills could actually be useful in those kinds of roles, or am I just grasping at straws here?\ntherapist: Your tech skills, like working with data and spreadsheets, can absolutely be valuable in policy or government roles! These fields often rely on data analysis and interpretation, so your experience could give you an edge. You could even highlight these skills in your applications or during interviews to show how they might be useful. Have you considered reaching out to professionals in these fields to learn more about their day-to-day work and what skills they value?\nclient: **Client:** Hey, nah, I haven’t reached out to any professionals yet, I wouldn’t even know how to go about that without feeling super awkward. Like, do I just cold email someone on LinkedIn or something, or is there a better way to connect without seeming weird or desperate? I’m kinda curious what they’d say about the data stuff, though, if it really is something they’d care about. Got any tips on how to start those convos without totally embarrassing myself?\ntherapist: Alright, let's summarize what we've discussed and outline your action steps and coping strategies.

Maybe there’s a way to dip your toe into these other areas without fully diving in—like volunteering a few hours a week or starting a small creative project on weekends? That way, you’re still nurturing your curiosity while keeping your nursing progress steady. What do you think might feel manageable to try first?\nclient: I think starting with something small, like volunteering a few hours a week, could work without throwing me off track with my nursing stuff. I’m just nervous about overcommitting, but maybe finding a short-term opportunity related to health or even something abroad could be a good test.\n\nI guess I’m also wondering, how do I even find those kinds of opportunities? Like, I don’t really know where to start looking for stuff that mixes health with travel or creativity without it being a full-on career change.\ntherapist: You’re already showing such thoughtful intention in balancing your nursing goals with your desire for exploration—that’s a strong foundation to build from. When it comes to finding those smaller opportunities, sometimes starting with local community organizations or even university programs that partner with global health initiatives can be a gentle way in. Have you ever considered reaching out to mentors or professors in your public health courses? They might know of projects that blend hands-on care with cultural experiences, or even creative outlets within healthcare, like health education through art or storytelling. What feels like the least overwhelming first step here—maybe a quick chat with someone in your network, or browsing a few websites during your next study break?\nclient: I think just having a quick chat with a professor or someone in my public health classes could be a good starting point without feeling too overwhelming. I’m kinda nervous about asking, but I guess they might have some ideas or connections I hadn’t thought of.\n\nI also wonder, though, if I start down this path and find something I like more than nursing, will I be wasting all the time I’ve put into my pre-reqs? Like, I don’t want to feel like I’m starting over again after switching majors so many times already.\ntherapist: It’s completely understandable to feel that worry—it takes courage to explore new paths while staying committed to the ones you’ve already walked. But what if these experiences actually enrich your nursing journey, rather than distract from it? For example, volunteering in health-focused travel programs might deepen your understanding of global health disparities, or a creative side project could help you communicate patient care more effectively. Even if your interests evolve, the skills you’re building now—like critical thinking, empathy, and adaptability—are incredibly transferable, no matter where life takes you. Maybe framing this as “adding tools to your toolkit” rather than “starting over” could ease some of that pressure? What feels like the smallest, least risky way to begin exploring that mindset shift?\nclient: I like the idea of thinking about it as adding tools rather than starting over—that makes it feel less like I’m throwing everything away. Maybe just starting with that convo with a professor, like we talked about, could be a small step to see how these other interests could fit with what I’m already doing.\n\nI guess I’m also curious if there’s a way to blend some of my creative side, like writing or art, into a health-related field without it being just a hobby. Do you think there’s a real space for that, or am I just dreaming too big here?\ntherapist: That’s such a thoughtful question—blending creativity with health work is actually a growing area, and people are finding innovative ways to make it happen. For instance, some nurses use art therapy to help patients process trauma, while others write patient stories to advocate for better care. Even if it feels like a stretch right now, exploring those connections might surprise you. What if you started by asking your professor if they know of any projects or roles that value both clinical skills and creative expression? That could be a gentle way to test the waters.\nclient: That sounds like a cool idea—I hadn’t really thought about something like art therapy or writing in a health context before. I’ll definitely bring it up with a professor and see if they know of anything like that I could dip my toes into.\n\nI’m just kinda worried, though, that even if I find something like this, it might not be stable or pay well enough to support myself. Like, I want to follow my passions, but I also don’t want to struggle financially after putting in all this work for a degree.\ntherapist: It’s a valid concern—security and passion don’t have to be at odds. Many nurses find creative roles in hospitals, nonprofits, or community programs that value both their clinical skills and innovative approaches. You could also explore hybrid roles where writing or art complement your nursing work, like creating patient education materials or designing wellness programs. What if you asked your professor about alumni who’ve carved out careers blending creativity and healthcare? That might give you a clearer picture of what’s possible without sacrificing stability.\nclient: Yeah, I think talking to a professor about alumni who’ve mixed creativity with healthcare could really help me see if there’s a practical way to make this work. I just don’t want to end up in a spot where I’m passionate about my job but can’t pay the bills, you know?\n\nI guess I’m also wondering how I even start figuring out if I’d be good at something like that—blending nursing with art or writing. Like, should I just try stuff out on my own, or are there specific programs or internships that could point me in the right direction without committing fully yet?\ntherapist: Great questions, and it’s awesome that you’re thinking ahead. For starters, you could try experimenting with small projects on your own—like creating educational materials or volunteering for a local health initiative that incorporates your creative side. This way, you can test the waters without committing fully. Also, you could reach out to alumni or professionals in these hybrid roles to learn more about their journeys. Remember, your nursing skills are a solid foundation, and your creativity can be the icing on the cake. Let’s make sure to revisit this conversation and see how things unfold.\nclient: Thanks for the ideas—I think starting with small projects on my own could be a low-pressure way to see if this feels right. I’ll also try connecting with some alumni to get a better sense of their paths.\n\nSo, I guess before we wrap up, do you think it’s okay to just take this one step at a time, or should I be mapping out a bigger plan right now? I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed thinking about all the possibilities.","completed":true}

I’m really struggling with my part-time master’s in plasma physics and just need to figure out what to do next.\ntherapist: I can only imagine how challenging this must be for you, especially with the demands of a part-time master's program in plasma physics. What's been on your mind lately about this situation?\nclient: Hey, I’ve just been feeling so unmotivated and out of place with this program. I’m really questioning if it’s the right path for me at all.\ntherapist: That sounds incredibly difficult, and I can understand why you're feeling this way. It's completely normal to question your path when you're struggling with something that requires such a significant investment of time and energy. Have you had any moments lately where you felt more connected to plasma physics, or is this feeling of being out of place something that's been building up over time?\nclient: Hey, honestly, I haven’t felt connected to plasma physics in a long time. It’s been more of a slow buildup of doubt, especially since coming back from my sabbatical.\ntherapist: It sounds like you've been carrying this doubt for a while, and it's really weighing on you. Let's take a step back and try to understand what's been fueling this doubt since your sabbatical. Is there something specific that's been making you question your connection to plasma physics, or is it more of a general feeling?\nclient: Hey, it’s more of a general feeling, like I’m just not cut out for this field. I keep thinking I’d be happier and better off sticking to engineering, where I feel more at home.\ntherapist: I hear you, and it's clear that engineering holds a sense of comfort and belonging for you. Can you tell me more about what makes engineering feel more like home compared to plasma physics?\nclient: Hey, yeah, engineering just feels more tangible to me, you know? Like, I can see the direct impact of my work, and it matches the skills I built during my undergrad.\ntherapist: It sounds like you appreciate the hands-on, practical nature of engineering and the sense of accomplishment it brings. On a scale of 0 to 10, how confident do you feel that pursuing engineering would truly align with your long-term goals and values, compared to the path you're currently on in plasma physics?\nclient: Hey, I’d say I’m probably at like an 8 or 9 for engineering fitting my long-term goals and values. It just feels right, way more than plasma physics, which is maybe at a 2 right now since I’m so disconnected from it.\ntherapist: That's really insightful. It seems like engineering is a clear fit for your goals and values, and you're leaning towards making a change. Let's start thinking about how you might transition into engineering and what steps you'd need to take to get there. What's one small action you could take this week to start exploring this option?\nclient: Hey, that’s a good question. I guess one small thing I could do this week is reach out to some old contacts from my undergrad or look up engineering job postings to see what’s out there and get a feel for what I might wanna aim for.\ntherapist: That sounds like a great starting point! Reconnecting with your undergrad contacts or browsing job postings can provide valuable insights into what's available in engineering and help you better understand how your skills might translate. What do you think could help you stay motivated to take these initial steps, even if things feel uncertain or challenging?\nclient: Hey, I think just reminding myself why I’m doing this, like focusing on how much more excited I get about engineering, could keep me going. Maybe also setting a small goal, like reaching out to one person or applying to one job by the end of the week, so it doesn’t feel overwhelming.\ntherapist: Alright, it sounds like you've got a solid plan to start exploring engineering opportunities.

Why do you want to be?\n\nFrom helpful videos I saw, it seems that preschool is pretty much about caring for the kids.\n\nFor elementary, a helpful youtuber said that the main challenges were these,\n\n* There's too many kids\n* There's not enough time to teach everything\n* They don't have effective ways of teaching and so blames the kids\n* They don't like repeating things\n* Problem of expecting kids to be like adults when they're kids is silly\n\nI guess if I didn't like these, maybe I also won't go into  elementary. Are there any other common challenges with elementary teaching?\n\nHear that it's likely better in other countries so if went into elementary in the future, would do it in other countries\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThought that I would like elementary more, but now I think would like preschool more\n\nOne preschool teacher was deciding between being a lawyer or a preschool teach and became a preschool teacher. There seems to be a bunch of preschool and homeschool videos that seem to be rlly good of ppl that review  teaching resources stuff instead of all the other ppl who just complains online on some sites\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a hs compared to elementary video, another helpful person said that there was a story in teaching hs where a student was excited about her clay project, but then when saw the teacher, became embarrassed to be excited about her clay project. This shows the damage and harm that some elementary teachers have done to kids\n\nI wasn't thinking about teaching hs in the future, and this is a good story that makes me think I'd like elementary much more than hs teaching. But atm, I like both less because it doesn't seem like too good of a life choice, but I'm not sure yet\n\nMaybe a principle or something would be a better idea. I dunno anymore\n\nWhat do you love about teaching, and why did you go into it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA helpful special ed teacher mostly said,\n\n* They had to use some of kind of \"research base program\" but it was mostly outdated since kids can't choose the readings they like\n* And it was boring to the kids since it was chosen for them and they can't choose it. And so become unrelatable to kids\n* They also said there was more paperwork, and since it was legal, it was stressful to them. I don't understand why it'd be stressful. They also said that they had a little bit of anxiety.

How do you think your life might look different if you were able to make that change, and what would be the most challenging part of implementing it?\nclient: Honestly, if I could make that change, I think I’d feel a lot less stressed having an extra day to focus on school or just recharge. The toughest part would probably be figuring out how to cover the lost income from dropping a shift, since I’m already pretty tight on cash.\ntherapist: It's clear that you're motivated to find a better balance between work, school, and self-care, and that extra day could make a big difference in your stress levels. Have you thought about any potential ways to make up for the lost income, or any other changes you could make to help ease that financial strain?\nclient: Yeah, I’ve been tossing around a few ideas, like maybe picking up some freelance coding gigs or tutoring on the side since I’m in CS. It’s just hard to know if I’d even have the time or energy to add something else to my plate right now.\ntherapist: I can see you're actively exploring ways to manage your time and finances more effectively, and it’s great that you're considering freelance work and tutoring as potential options. Given your current energy levels and schedule, it might be helpful to brainstorm some smaller, more manageable steps you could take to start testing these ideas without feeling overwhelmed.\nclient: Yeah, I like the idea of starting small since I’m already stretched pretty thin. Maybe I could just look into a couple of quick freelance projects or see if there’s demand for tutoring without committing to anything big right away.\ntherapist: That sounds like a great approach, starting small and exploring your options without taking on too much at once. It might also be helpful to set a specific goal for the next week or two, like dedicating a few hours to researching freelance platforms or reaching out to potential tutoring clients, to help keep you on track without feeling overwhelmed.\nclient: Cool, I think setting a small goal like that could really help me stay focused without freaking out over adding more to my plate. I’ll probably set aside a couple of hours next week to check out some freelance sites like Upwork or maybe ask around in my CS department about tutoring needs.\ntherapist: It's awesome to see you're taking the initiative to break this down into smaller, manageable tasks! How about we also talk about any potential roadblocks you might encounter while researching these opportunities, and figure out some strategies to overcome them?\nclient: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea to think ahead about stuff that might get in the way. I’m guessing things like not finding gigs quick enough or just feeling too wiped out from classes could trip me up, so I’d like to figure out how to handle that.\ntherapist: Great to see you're being proactive about tackling these challenges! Let's summarize what we've covered so far and outline a plan to keep you moving forward. \n**Key goals**: \n1. Balance part-time job and computer science classes effectively.\n2. Explore freelance or tutoring opportunities to alleviate financial strain.\n**Action steps**: \n1. Dedicate a few hours next week to research freelance platforms like Upwork.\n2. Reach out to potential tutoring clients in your CS department.\n**Coping strategies**: \n1. Break tasks into smaller, manageable steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n2. Set specific goals for researching freelance and tutoring opportunities.\n3. Anticipate potential roadblocks and develop strategies to overcome them.\n**Next steps**: \n1. Follow through with your research and outreach plan for next week.\n2. Check in with me to discuss progress and address any challenges that arise.\nRemember, you've got this! Taking it one step at a time and being prepared for obstacles will help you stay on track. Keep up the great work!\nclient: Thanks for laying it all out like that—it really helps to see the plan in one place. I’m feeling pretty good about taking these next steps and checking back in with you soon.","completed":true}

Its been a month since my course started and I had been enjoying it, despite the immense work load and studying.\n\nJust academic pressure was ok with me, I'm used to it. However recently they started interviews for student committees and clubs which took a toll on me because my midterm exams are in 2 days and these clubs are all making us do complicated and time consuming tasks right before the exam. \n\nI'm a bit of a perfectionist, so when the club I really wanted to join initially, asked us to submit like 10 documents including videos, budgeting plan, etc etc all within 10 hours, I got really stressed out, thinking that my whole day and night will go into this and I'll not be able to study for my exams.\n\nI wanted to do the best in both. But I realised that if I attempt to do the best in the club activity, my exams will suffer, and vice versa. I'm required to study more than other students because I come from a Science background so it's difficult to understand commerce related subjects. I ended up getting a terrible headache, chills, fever, and by the night I was not in a state to finish anything and was crying like a fool.\n\nI dropped out of the selection process for all clubs because in the end I felt like academics are more important for me and not something I can sacrifice for clubs that only host events n stuff. \n\nNow its morning, the next day, and I feel better and relaxed because now my only focus is studying. \n\nMy peers told me that joining clubs is not necessary, and that I can do other extra-curriculars and spend my time in getting the most knowledge I can, learning new skills, and participating in competitons.\n\nWas there anything wrong with what I did? I felt like I lacked management skills and ended up getting stressed, which made me think that different people have different capacity, but that felt like a limiting mindset, that I'm incapable of managing both activities at once.\n\nActually it was my inability to give my 100% in both areas that made me anxious to this extent.\n\nWhat do you guys suggest?

I'm here to listen and support you in any way I can. Is there something specific you'd like to talk about, or perhaps a concern you've been carrying that you'd like to explore?\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here. I’ve been really stressed lately with school and some decisions I had to make, and I just want to figure out if I’m handling things the right way.\ntherapist: It sounds like you've been juggling a lot of different things and feeling overwhelmed. I can understand why you'd want to take a closer look at how you're handling everything.\nclient: client: Yeah, exactly, I’ve been feeling so overwhelmed trying to balance everything. I just want to know if I made the right call by stepping back from some stuff to focus on my studies.\ntherapist: It seems like you've been really thoughtful about your priorities and made a decision that you felt was necessary. How do you feel about the choice you made, now that you've had some time to reflect on it?\nclient: I feel a bit relieved, honestly, since I’m not stretched so thin anymore. But I’m also kinda worried that I might’ve missed out on something important by stepping back.\ntherapist: It's great that you've found some relief by stepping back, but I can understand your worry about potentially missing out on something important. It might be helpful to explore what that \"\"something important\"\" could be and how it might align with your priorities.\nclient: Yeah, I think that \"something important\" might be the chance to build connections or gain experiences that could help me later on. I just don’t know if I’m limiting myself by focusing only on academics right now, you know?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're weighing the benefits of prioritizing your studies against the potential opportunities you might be missing out on. How do you think your studies will contribute to your future goals and aspirations, and how might they align with the connections or experiences you're worried about missing out on?\nclient: Honestly, I think my studies are the foundation for what I want to achieve, like getting a solid job and building a career in business, even though I’m coming from a science background. I just worry that without those club experiences or networking, I might not stand out as much when I’m looking for opportunities later.\ntherapist: That's a valid concern. Networking and building connections can be important for career opportunities. However, it's also important to consider that a strong foundation in your studies can open doors as well. How do you think you can balance these two aspects and create a plan that works for you?\nclient: I get that both are important, and I don’t wanna miss out on either, but I’m just not sure how to make it work without feeling overwhelmed again. Like, maybe I could try smaller ways to network or get involved that don’t eat up all my study time, but I’m not even sure where to start with that.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you're feeling uncertain about how to balance your academic and extracurricular commitments without feeling overwhelmed. Let's focus on identifying some small steps you could take to explore networking opportunities without compromising your studies. What are some ideas that come to mind for you?\nclient: I guess I could start by just attending some club meetings or events casually, without taking on big roles or tasks that stress me out. Maybe even connecting with a few people online, like through LinkedIn or school forums, could be a low-pressure way to build some relationships while still keeping my focus on studying. What do you think about that? I’m just worried I might still spread myself too thin, you know? Like, even small steps feel a bit daunting when I’m already trying to keep up with my coursework. How do people usually figure out what’s the right amount of involvement without burning out?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're on the right track by considering smaller, more manageable steps to get involved without overcommitting yourself. Maybe we can start by exploring what specific clubs or events feel most aligned with your goals and interests, so you can prioritize those over others. Additionally, setting aside a specific time each week for networking, such as an hour or two on weekends, could help you maintain a balance between academics and extracurriculars. How does that sound to you?\nclient: That sounds pretty doable, actually. Like, setting aside just an hour or two on weekends for networking or checking out a club event feels way less intimidating than jumping into big commitments right away. I think I could handle that without it messing with my study schedule too much. But I’m still kinda nervous about picking the right clubs or events to focus on—there are so many, and I don’t wanna waste time on stuff that won’t really help me in the long run. How do I figure out which ones are worth my energy when I’m already stretched with classes?\ntherapist: That's a great question, and it's totally normal to feel uncertain about which opportunities to prioritize. One approach could be to start by identifying a few clubs or events that align most closely with your career goals and interests, and then attend one or two meetings or events to see if they feel like a good fit. You could also ask people in your network for recommendations, or do some research online to learn more about different groups and their activities.

Please feel free to share anything that's been on your mind or anything you'd like to discuss. I'm here to listen and support you in any way I can.\nclient: Hey, thanks for having me. I’m just really stressed about college and dealing with people, and I’m not sure how to handle it.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to cope with the demands of college and social interactions. That's completely understandable. Can you tell me more about what's been causing you the most stress lately?\nclient: Honestly, it’s just the thought of having to talk to people and be in group settings that freaks me out the most. I’ve always struggled with this, and I’m worried it’s gonna mess up my whole college experience.\ntherapist: It's clear that social interactions and group settings have been a source of stress for you for a while now, and that worry about how it might impact your college experience is weighing heavily on your mind. It's completely understandable to feel anxious about these situations, especially when they're so central to the college experience. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes these situations so challenging for you?\nclient: Hey, yeah, it’s like every time I think about speaking up or being around new people, I just freeze up and my mind goes blank. I’m scared I’ll look stupid or mess things up, and it feels like there’s no way out of it.\ntherapist: It sounds like the fear of being judged or not being able to express yourself properly is really paralyzing for you. That feeling of being trapped in your own thoughts must be incredibly frustrating. Can you tell me more about what happens in those moments when you freeze up? What's going through your mind when you feel like you can't speak up?\nclient: Hey, when I freeze up, it’s like my heart starts racing and I just can’t get any words out, no matter how hard I try. It’s like I’m stuck in my head, overthinking every little thing, and I just feel completely helpless.\ntherapist: It's clear that these moments of freezing up are incredibly distressing and overwhelming for you. It's understandable to feel trapped in your own thoughts and to be unable to express yourself when you're in the midst of that anxiety. I wonder, have you ever noticed any moments where you've been able to break through that feeling of helplessness, even if just for a little while?\nclient: Hey, honestly, I can’t really think of any time where I’ve been able to push past that helpless feeling. It just kinda takes over, and I end up avoiding the situation altogether if I can.\ntherapist: It's completely understandable that you feel like this helpless feeling takes over, especially when it's been such a persistent and overwhelming experience for you. It might be helpful to explore what life would look like if you were able to break through that feeling, even if just for a moment. Can you imagine what it would be like to feel more confident in social interactions or group settings?\nclient: Hey, I mean, I’ve tried picturing it, but it feels so far out of reach, like I can’t even imagine not being stuck in my head. I just keep thinking I’ll mess up or people will judge me, and it’s hard to see past that.\ntherapist: That’s a tough feeling to carry, and it’s understandable that it feels hard to see past those worries. What if we focused on just one small moment when you felt even slightly less stuck in your head—could we explore that together, and see if there’s anything we can learn from it?\nclient: Hey, I’m not sure if I can even pinpoint a moment like that, to be honest. It’s like, every time I’m in a social spot, the anxiety just hits hard, and I’m back to square one.\ntherapist: That makes sense, and it's completely okay that you're not able to pinpoint a specific moment right now. Let's try to imagine what a small step towards breaking through that feeling might look like, even if it's just a hypothetical scenario. What would it feel like to take a deep breath, focus on the present moment, and allow yourself to be there, without judgment or pressure to perform?\nclient: Hey, I guess I can try to imagine that, but even thinking about being in the moment without all the pressure feels kinda impossible. It’s like my brain just automatically jumps to worst-case scenarios, and I don’t know how to stop it.\ntherapist: That’s really insightful to notice how your brain automatically jumps to worst-case scenarios, and it’s okay that it feels impossible right now. Let’s explore what it might feel like to pause just for a moment, take a deep breath, and gently remind yourself that you’re safe, even when your brain starts spiraling into those scenarios.\nclient: Hey, I can try to picture that, I guess, but it’s really hard to believe I’m safe when my mind is just racing with all these ‘what ifs.’ Like, even the idea of pausing feels kinda scary ‘cause I’m worried I’ll lose control or something.\ntherapist: I hear how hard it is to feel safe when your mind is racing, and it makes sense that the idea of pausing feels scary. Let’s explore what it might be like to imagine a moment where you’re able to take just one small step towards feeling a bit safer, even if it’s just for a few seconds. What would that moment look like?\nclient: Hey, I’m not sure what that moment would even look like, to be honest. It’s like, even thinking about feeling safer for just a few seconds feels out of reach when my head’s spinning with all these worries.\ntherapist: It’s okay that it feels out of reach right now. Let’s try to imagine a moment where you might feel a tiny bit safer. Maybe it’s as simple as noticing the weight of your feet on the ground, or the rhythm of your breath. What if you allowed yourself to just sit with that feeling, without trying to fix it or make it bigger, just for a moment?\nclient: Hey, I can try to think about that, I guess, but even focusing on something small like my feet or my breath feels kinda overwhelming. It’s like my mind just won’t slow down enough to let me notice anything without freaking out.\ntherapist: That makes sense, and it’s okay that it feels overwhelming. Maybe we can start by just noticing how it feels to sit with this moment, without trying to change it or make it bigger. What would it be like to simply allow yourself to be here, just as you are, even if it’s uncomfortable?\nclient: Hey, I guess I can try just sitting with it, but it’s really tough to just be okay with feeling this uncomfortable. Like, my brain keeps telling me I need to figure out a way to fix this or escape it somehow.\ntherapist: That's understandable, and it takes courage to even consider sitting with that discomfort. It sounds like your brain is trying to protect you by pushing you to fix or escape, but what if we explored what might happen if you allowed yourself to simply be with that feeling for just a few seconds, without needing to change it?\nclient: Hey, I’m willing to give it a shot, but I’m honestly scared that even a few seconds of sitting with this feeling might make things worse. Like, what if I just spiral even more instead of feeling any kind of relief?\ntherapist: It’s completely natural to feel that way, and it’s brave of you to even consider taking this step. What if we tried it together, just for a few seconds, and I’ll be right here with you, holding space for whatever arises? You can always come back to the conversation whenever you need to.\nclient: Hey, okay, I’m down to try it with you here, since I feel a bit safer knowing you’ve got my back. I’m just nervous about what might come up, ya know, but I’ll give it a go for a few seconds.\ntherapist: That's great to hear, and I'm glad you feel safer with me here. Let's take those few seconds together, and remember, I'll be right here with you. Just breathe, and let whatever comes up be there without judgment.\nclient: Hey, alright, I’m breathing and trying to just let it be, but my heart’s kinda racing already. I’m worried I might not handle whatever pops up, but I’m sticking with it for now since you’re here.\ntherapist: That’s great that you’re giving yourself the space to explore this feeling, and I’m right here with you. Let’s keep going, and remember, you can stop anytime if it gets too intense. How are you feeling in this moment?\nclient: Hey, I’m still feeling pretty jittery, like my heart’s not slowing down, but I’m trying to stick with it. It’s just hard to not overthink everything that’s coming up, ya know?\ntherapist: That's okay, it's completely normal to feel that way, especially when you're pushing yourself outside your comfort zone. It's great that you're sticking with it, and remember, I'm right here to support you.\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here, it really helps knowing I’m not alone in this.

I've looked at some of the speaker's speeches, and her website, and she very clearly talks about sex and gender being the same thing, how that wasn't God's original plan, how we're destroying his \"sweet language,\" that trans people aren't real, how it's all deception... etc. There is an LGBTQIA+ organization on campus, and they're leading the protest with the assistance of some local churches. \n\nI also realize that I may have used 'hate speech' incorrectly, and I do understand that despite how weird it is, it is protected under the First Amendment.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome!

I'm so glad you're here. Please take your time, and feel free to share whatever's on your mind.\nclient: Hey, thanks for having me. I’m just feeling really overwhelmed with everything going on at school right now and could use some help sorting through it.\ntherapist: I can only imagine how tough that must be, especially when it feels like everything is piling up at once. What’s been the most challenging part of it all for you so far?\nclient: Hey, honestly, the hardest part is just feeling so helpless about the situation on campus with that speaker coming in. It’s like no matter what I do, I can’t shake this sense of being targeted or unsafe, you know?\ntherapist: That sounds incredibly isolating, and it must be really disheartening to feel like your efforts aren’t making a difference. Can you tell me more about what’s been contributing to that sense of being targeted or unsafe with the speaker coming in?\nclient: Yeah, it’s just this constant weight, feeling like my identity is under attack with the kind of stuff this speaker promotes. It’s hard to even focus on classes or anything else when it feels like the university isn’t fully backing me up on this.\ntherapist: It sounds like this speaker's presence has really disrupted your sense of safety and belonging on campus, and it's understandable that you'd feel like your identity is being challenged. It must be exhausting to constantly feel like you're fighting an uphill battle. Have you been able to talk to anyone about this, or has it felt like you've been carrying this weight alone?\nclient: Yeah, I’ve talked to some friends and people from the LGBTQIA+ group on campus, which helps a bit knowing I’m not totally alone in this. But even with that support, it still feels like I’m carrying a lot of this anxiety on my own, especially when I’m just trying to get through the day.\ntherapist: It’s great that you’ve been able to find some support through your friends and the LGBTQIA+ group, but it’s also completely valid to feel like you’re still carrying a lot of this anxiety on your own. It sounds like the situation with the speaker has really shaken your sense of security on campus. What do you think would need to happen for you to feel more supported and less alone in this struggle?\nclient: Honestly, I think if the university took a stronger stance, like maybe issuing a statement that acknowledges how this speaker’s views can harm students like me, it’d make a huge difference. I just want to feel like they’ve got my back, you know, instead of hiding behind ‘free speech’ as an excuse to do nothing.\ntherapist: It sounds like having the university's explicit support would provide a sense of safety and validation that you're currently missing. What steps do you think could be taken to encourage the university to make that kind of statement, and how might that shift your experience on campus?\nclient: I guess maybe joining the protests or working with the LGBTQIA+ group to push for a meeting with administration could help get our voices heard. I feel like if enough of us speak up, they might have to at least acknowledge the impact this is having, and that could make campus feel a little less hostile for me.\ntherapist: That sounds like a proactive way to bring attention to the issue and potentially influence the university's response. If you were to take that step, how do you think it would align with your personal values, and how might that sense of advocacy affect your overall well-being and safety on campus?\nclient: I think getting involved like that really matches up with my need to stand up for myself and others who feel the same way, like it’s important to me to not just sit back and let this slide. I feel like taking action could help me feel a bit more in control and less helpless, even if it’s just a small step toward making campus feel safer.\ntherapist: It’s really powerful that you’re connecting this action with your personal values of self-advocacy and standing up for others. Taking even a small step toward creating change could help you regain a sense of control and agency in this situation. How might you start to make this action plan a reality, and what support systems could help you stay motivated along the way?\nclient: I think starting by reaching out to the LGBTQIA+ group on campus to see how I can help with the protest or any meetings they’re planning with admin would be a good first step. Having friends or maybe even some supportive professors to talk to and lean on would definitely keep me going, especially if things get tough or discouraging.\ntherapist: Reaching out to the LGBTQIA+ group sounds like a solid first move, and having a supportive network of friends and professors can make a big difference in staying motivated. How do you plan to reach out to the group, and are there any specific people you'd like to talk to or activities you'd like to get involved in?\nclient: I think I’ll probably just send an email or check if they have a group chat or social media page to message them about joining in on the protest or helping with planning stuff. I’d really like to connect with some of the organizers and maybe get involved in brainstorming ways to push for a convo with admin, and I’ve got a couple of friends who are already in the group that I can ask for intros.\ntherapist: That sounds like a solid plan. What specific steps do you think you could take to reach out to the LGBTQIA+ group and get involved in their efforts? And how do you plan to stay connected with your supportive friends and professors as you move forward with this action plan?\nclient: I’m thinking I’ll start by finding their contact info on the campus website or shooting a quick message through their Instagram or whatever platform they’re active on to ask about joining the protest and helping out.

{"id":"111d3h7","timestamp":1676246400000,"category":"emotional","concern":"I've been struggling most of my life with pretty bad depression, and things only started to get better after my first year in college. But now I've fallen back into it, very deeply. I don't know how much to share but for an idea of how bad it's gotten, I have been skipping a lot of my classes and not doing any of my assignments, nor caring enough to do anything about it. I have suicidal thoughts, and I'm trying to get onto antidepressants but it's difficult to get diagnosis and seek medical help due to conflict with my parents and school. I've also been trying to get diagnosed with ADHD, which I've been pretty sure I have for a long time now, but that has been difficult too. I have a therapist I see twice a week, which has been helpful sometimes, but I think I need more.\n\nI don't think I can keep going like this. my last semester I got all A's, so to outsiders it seems like I'm doing fine, but man, I'm an art student. Grades barely matter, and those A's are more indicative of how generous and understanding my professors were; in reality I barely attended class, finished less than half of my projects the whole semester, and dropped classes to go part-time, hoping it would help, but it wasn't enough. \n\nMy parents and my therapist have basically told me different versions of \"just power through it\", but I can't. Especially because all of my assignments are art. It's not a set start or finish, a list of questions to answer, or busywork. It's always personal and being creative is really hard for me right now, almost impossible. My parents are also scared that if I take a leave of absence and get a job or something, I'll be stuck doing that forever and never go back to school. The only person that has suggested that a leave might be a good idea was my advisor. \n\nBut I know a lot of people deal with depression in college, and they still carry on. Am I just being lazy, or giving up too easily? Just making an excuse to do nothing? I want to spend the time off seeking more active mental help, but is that enough reason? I don't know anymore.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello! I'm so glad you're here.

To achieve this, we've agreed on a few action steps:\n- Set aside 10 minutes each morning for sketching, focusing on the process rather than perfection.\n- Establish a weekly accountability method, such as recording a voice memo or meeting with a supportive friend, to reflect on your progress and challenges.\n- Practice self-compassion by repeating the phrase \"\"I'm doing my best, and that's enough\"\" when you encounter setbacks or feelings of guilt.\nFor days when sketching may not be feasible, we can explore alternative small tasks or activities that still contribute to your well-being, such as taking a short walk, journaling, or engaging in a relaxing hobby.\nMoving forward, remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. It's essential to be gentle with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way. If you encounter any challenges or concerns, feel free to reach out, and we can adjust your plan accordingly. Remember, taking care of your mental health is a brave and\nclient: **Client:** Thanks for summarizing everything—it helps to have it all laid out like this. I’m feeling a bit more hopeful with these small steps, and having alternatives like a walk or journaling for off days sounds really practical. Can we check in again soon to see how it’s going, just to make sure I’m not getting too stuck or overwhelmed?","completed":true}
{"id":"1fwghnn","timestamp":1728086400000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"As the title says my roommate doesn’t clean up after themself. Now our room isn’t a complete disaster and it’s mainly their side (plus our bathroom but it’s kinda 70\/30 on who makes the most mess of it) but they just don’t really clean up. They have cups and cans and bottles all over their nightstand and desk and have even had a cup under their bed on the dresser before, and they’re never empty either. They also go home every weekend so they don’t really have dishes or real food here so they’re all Starbucks and Dunkin’ cups, so half full coffees just sitting there separating for weeks as they go home and come back. They do sorta clean it after a few weeks, I’ve seen them bag up the cups and other garbage, but they don’t take it out. They have bags full of garbage in the corner on their side of the room and our rooms not big so it’s starting to creep towards our closet almost in the way of it. As for the bathroom they leave hair everywhere and I know it’s theirs and not mine because it’s their little rubber bands with the hair. Now like I said I am also at fault for the the bathroom being messy but I try to keep it somewhat clean by taking out the garbage and have cleaned the shower drain but they don’t even try to clean up a bit. I don’t know how they don’t get embarrassed when they have a friend over or even just with me being here. I get embarrassed having 2 cans on my desk and a few dirty forks or spoons for a few days because I’m too tired to wash them yet. Otherwise they’re a good roommate it’s just they never clean. I should also say they had a single room last year so it definitely feels like part of the reason since they would be used to not sharing a space but I want to have friends over and I’m embarrassed for my roommate. I don’t really know how to tell them to take their garbage out without sounding like a bitch and I already accepted I’m gonna be cleaning our bathroom alone.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome to our session today!

I'm glad you're here today. I'm all ears, and I want you to feel comfortable sharing whatever's on your mind. Is there something specific you'd like to talk about, or would you like to start wherever you feel is most important?\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here to listen. I’m just really torn about whether to live on campus or commute, and I’d like to dive into that since it’s been weighing on me a lot.\ntherapist: That sounds like a tough decision, and it's great that you're taking the time to think it through. What are some of the things that are making this choice so difficult for you?\nclient: Hey, yeah, it’s just really hard to weigh the pros and cons, you know? I’m worried about making the right call with so little time left to decide.\ntherapist: That's understandable. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to make the right decision, and that can be really stressful. Can you tell me more about what's weighing on your mind when you think about living on campus versus commuting?\nclient: Hey, yeah, it’s just this constant back-and-forth in my head about what I’m gaining or losing either way. I’m worried about missing out on stuff or making a choice I’ll regret, and it’s stressing me out with the deadline so close.\ntherapist: That back-and-forth can be exhausting, especially with a deadline looming. It sounds like you're caught between the idea of fully immersing yourself in campus life and the comforts of staying close to home. Do you feel like you're leaning toward one option more than the other, or does it still feel like a total toss-up?\nclient: Hey, honestly, it still feels like a total toss-up most of the time. I keep going in circles, and I’m just not sure which way to lean with everything on the line.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're really feeling the weight of this decision, and it's completely understandable that you're struggling to see a clear path forward. Have you considered exploring what your life might look like in a year if you choose one option versus the other, to see if that helps you visualize what feels more aligned with your goals and values?\nclient: Hey, yeah, I haven’t really thought about it that way, like picturing where I’d be a year from now with each choice. I guess I’ve been so stuck on the immediate stuff that looking ahead like that could maybe help me figure out what I really want.\ntherapist: That's a great insight! Let's see if we can unpack this a bit further. What would your ideal day look like in a year if you were living on campus versus commuting?\nclient: Hey, that’s a good question, and I’m kinda trying to picture it now. If I’m on campus, I see myself being super involved, like hanging out with friends after classes, doing events with that leadership program, and just feeling part of everything, but I worry about the cost dragging me down. If I’m commuting, I think my days would be more chill, saving money and sticking to a routine at home, but I’m scared I’d feel left out or like I’m missing the full college vibe. I guess I just don’t know which version of my future feels more “me.”\ntherapist: That's a really thoughtful reflection. It sounds like both options have their pros and cons. Can you tell me a bit more about what you mean by the “full college vibe” and why that feels important to you?\nclient: Hey, yeah, when I say “full college vibe,” I guess I mean just being immersed in that whole campus life, like staying up late talking with friends in the dorms, going to random events, and feeling like I’m really part of a community. It’s important to me because I don’t want to look back and feel like I missed out on those experiences, you know?\ntherapist: It sounds like the idea of being part of a campus community and having those spontaneous experiences really resonates with you. Let's see if we can explore that a bit further. On a scale of 0 to 10, how important is being immersed in that college vibe to you, and what would you say is the main reason it feels so crucial?\nclient: Hey, I’d probably rate it like an 8 or 9 out of 10, honestly, because I feel like college is this unique time to connect with people and grow in ways I can’t just by staying at home. The main reason it feels so crucial is that I’m worried if I don’t dive into that community now, I’ll regret it later and wonder what I could’ve gotten out of those experiences.\ntherapist: Based on your reflections, it seems like the importance of being immersed in campus life really centers around your desire for connection and growth. It sounds like you’re weighing the potential long-term impact of your decision, both in terms of personal fulfillment and future opportunities. As you consider the options, what steps do you think would help you feel more confident in your choice, whether that’s diving into the campus experience or creating a fulfilling routine at home?\nclient: Hey, that’s a good point to think about, and I guess I need to figure out some ways to make either choice feel right. Maybe I could talk to some people who’ve done both—dorming and commuting—to see how they handled it, and also look into if there’s any way to cut costs if I live on campus, like scholarships or part-time work. What do you think about starting there, or do you have any other ideas for figuring this out?\ntherapist: Based on what you've shared, exploring those options—talking to others who've done both and looking into cost-saving strategies—could give you valuable insights and help you feel more confident in your decision. It also aligns with your goal of balancing connection, growth, and practical considerations. Another idea might be to imagine what your ideal college experience would look like a year from now, and see which choice best supports that vision.\nclient: Hey, I like that idea of picturing where I want to be a year from now—it kinda helps put things into perspective.

And hey, if you do overthink things, you could even acknowledge it playfully with something like, \"\"Oops, I'm doing it again!\"\" to help lighten the moment.\nclient: Yeah, setting a small goal like asking one question sounds doable, and I think it might take some of the pressure off. I’m just still kinda worried that even with that, I’ll freeze up or say something dumb, you know?\ntherapist: Let's summarize your goals and action steps for our next session. We discussed the importance of focusing on being present and genuinely curious when engaging in social interactions, rather than striving for perfection. To help you achieve this, we agreed on setting a small intention before entering social situations, such as asking one person a question about their interests. We also discussed acknowledging overthinking moments playfully to help lighten the situation.\nFor your next steps, practice setting small intentions for social interactions and remember that the goal is to be present and genuinely curious. Try to reframe your thinking by reminding yourself that being different isn't a bad thing and that others may feel just as nervous as you do. Lastly, don't forget to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes.\nRemember, it's all about taking small steps towards your goals, and I'm here to support you along the way. Let's continue to work on these strategies in our next session.\nclient: Thanks for summarizing everything, I really appreciate the reminder to take small steps and be kind to myself. I’m still a bit nervous about putting this into practice, but I’ll give it a shot and see how it feels.","completed":true}

I’m stuck between wanting to start college now and waiting to maybe get into a better, cheaper school next year.\ntherapist: You're caught between the excitement of diving in right away and the potential benefits of waiting for a better fit. That must feel really overwhelming, like you're balancing two opposing ideas. Can you tell me more about what makes each option so tempting?\nclient: Hey, yeah, it’s definitely overwhelming trying to weigh both sides. Like, starting now feels exciting because I’d finally be on my own and moving forward, but waiting could mean a school that’s a better match and way less of a financial burden.\ntherapist: I can hear how much you want to make the right choice for yourself, and how much you care about your future. Both options seem to hold so much potential, and it's understandable that you're feeling stuck. Can you help me understand what's most important to you in this decision, and what you might regret more later on?\nclient: Hey, yeah, I think what’s most important to me is getting into a program that’s the best fit for what I want to do, you know, without putting too much stress on my family financially. I guess I’d regret more if I rushed into a school now and then felt like I missed out on a better opportunity—or if I wait and don’t get in anywhere better next year, that’d suck too.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're really wrestling with two strong priorities: finding the best fit for your goals and being mindful of the financial impact on your family.

I'm here to listen and support you, so please feel free to share whatever's on your mind.\nclient: Thanks for being here. I’m just feeling really overwhelmed and hurt by some stuff that’s happened with my degree supervisors, and it’s messing with my head a lot.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're going through a really tough time with your supervisors, and it's completely understandable that you'd feel overwhelmed and hurt. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on?\nclient: Yeah, it’s just been a rough situation that’s left me feeling really betrayed and down. I’m struggling to even focus on my studies now because of it.\ntherapist: It's clear that this situation has had a significant impact on your well-being and academic focus. I can imagine how difficult it must be to feel betrayed and overwhelmed by the people who are supposed to support you. Would you feel comfortable sharing more about what specifically has happened with your supervisors?\nclient: Honestly, I’m not sure if I’m ready to dive into all the details just yet, it’s still pretty raw. I just feel so stuck and don’t know how to move forward with everything weighing on me like this.\ntherapist: I completely understand, and there's no rush to share more than you're comfortable with right now. It's important to acknowledge that you're feeling stuck and weighed down, and I'm here to support you in finding a way forward. Let's take it one step at a time, and focus on what feels manageable for you.\nclient: Yeah, I appreciate that, I really do. I guess I just need to figure out how to deal with being around them so much without feeling like I’m crumbling inside every time.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're trying to find a way to navigate these difficult interactions without letting them consume your emotions. It's a tough balance, but I'm curious, have you noticed any moments when you felt a bit more in control or grounded in these situations?\nclient: Yeah, not really, honestly. It’s like every time I’m in their lectures or working on their stuff, it just hits me all over again and I feel so out of place, like I don’t even belong there.\ntherapist: I can sense the weight of those emotions, and it's understandable that it feels overwhelming to be in those situations. I'm curious, what would it look like for you to feel like you belong there again?\nclient: I don’t even know if that’s possible anymore, to be honest. Like, I keep thinking about how things used to be and how much I looked up to them, and now it’s just this big mess in my head that I can’t shake.\ntherapist: I can see how those memories and feelings of respect are tangled up with the present challenges, creating a heavy emotional knot. Let's explore this idea of feeling like you belong again - even if it seems impossible now, can you imagine what one small step towards that feeling might look like?\nclient: I guess maybe just being able to sit in their class without overthinking every word they say would be a start. It’s hard to picture even that, though, when I’m just stuck feeling so hurt and outta place all the time.\ntherapist: It sounds like even a small shift, like being able to sit in class without overthinking, would make a big difference for you. I'm curious, what might it take for you to feel just a little more grounded in that moment, even if it's not a complete solution?\nclient: I think maybe just focusing on something else during class, like taking notes or really zoning in on the material, could help me not spiral so much. It’s tough though, ‘cause my mind just keeps wandering back to everything that’s happened, and I don’t know how to stop it.\ntherapist: It's interesting that you've already identified a potential strategy for staying grounded, like focusing on the material or taking notes. That shows you have some insight into what could help. If you were to try that in class, how do you think it might shift your experience, even if just a little?\nclient: I think it might help me feel a bit less overwhelmed, like I’m actually doing something productive instead of just sitting there stuck in my head. I’m not sure if it’ll fully stop the thoughts, but maybe it could at least give me a little break from them for a while.\ntherapist: That's a really thoughtful approach you've described, and it's encouraging to hear that you're open to trying it out. It sounds like even a brief reprieve from those intrusive thoughts could make a meaningful difference in how you experience class. I'm curious, what would it feel like for you to have that small break, even if it's just for a few moments?\nclient: I think it would feel like a tiny bit of relief, honestly, like I could breathe a little easier for those few minutes. It wouldn’t fix everything, but just having a moment where I’m not drowning in those feelings would be something, ya know?\ntherapist: It's great to hear that even a small moment of relief could be so meaningful for you. What would it take for you to actually try out this strategy in class, and how might you remind yourself to focus on taking notes or engaging with the material when your mind starts to wander?\nclient: I guess it would take just pushing myself to start, like making a conscious effort to pick up my pen or really listen to what’s being said. Maybe I could set a little reminder, like a sticky note on my notebook that says ‘focus’ or something, to snap me back if I start drifting off.\ntherapist: That sounds like a solid plan, and the sticky note idea could be a helpful visual cue. If you do try it out, what would be a way for you to acknowledge and celebrate even the smallest success, like managing to focus for a few minutes?\nclient: I think just noticing that I managed to stay on track for a bit would feel good, like giving myself a mental pat on the back. Maybe I could even jot down a quick note about it after class to kinda remind myself I did something positive, ya know?\ntherapist: That sounds like a thoughtful way to acknowledge your progress, and writing down those moments of focus could help you track your successes over time. What might be a few specific situations where you could try out this strategy first, to test the waters and build some confidence in its effectiveness?\nclient: I think I could start with the shorter lectures or maybe the ones where I feel a tiny bit less overwhelmed, just to ease into it. Like, there’s this one class that’s not as intense, so maybe trying it there first would be a good way to test it out, ya know?\ntherapist: Great, it sounds like you've got a clear plan in place. Remember to celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem, and to continue building on your progress. It's all about taking things one step at a time and being patient with yourself. You've got this! And don't forget, if you need any further support, I'm always here to help.\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate the encouragement and knowing I can reach out if I need to. I’ll give it a shot in that class and see how it feels, just taking it slow like you said.\ntherapist: As we wrap up today's session, let's take a moment to reflect on the progress we've made together. You've identified some practical strategies to help you regain a sense of control over your academic focus and emotional well-being. These include:\n- Focusing on class material during less intense lectures\n- Acknowledging and celebrating even the smallest successes\n- Using visual cues like sticky notes as reminders\nRemember that progress may not always be linear, and it's important to be patient with yourself as you work through these challenges.

{"id":"10aqcs8","timestamp":1673568000000,"category":"school_life","concern":"So this is a long story and I'm currently in a bit of a unique situation because of which there's no one irl who i can ask for reliable advice so as much as reddit is really not the place to be asking for advice on life changing decisions i've got no other options and here we go.\n\n**TDLR:  was a good student, went to horrible uni and tried to survive. now burnt out, looking to transfer but bc of horrid uni application is fucked. thinking of dropping out want to know abt how likelihood of job opportunities for foreign drop-outs. read passages marked \\* for a longer summary**\n\n**\\*** The story basically goes that, I am an Indian citizen, but i've lived my whole life abroad so i know as much about India as ur next door neighbour + like 5%, okay. At the end of high school, I blindly trusted my parents' suggestion and got into and started attending a top 10 indian uni which has now become the single worst decision i've ever made in my entire life.\n\nAs it turned out, my uni is 100% fucked up. I could go on abt it for days but we don't have time to give a short summary of the vibes: extreme mismanagement of an institution, horrible facilities\/classrooms, no sense of academic integrity, poor teaching, no sort of proper functioning basic 'services' like student welfare or career counselors provided, straight up illegal shit like holding classes in a construction site, the fact that you DON'T HAVE WIFI NOR DOES MOBILE DATA WORK BC NETWORK IS SO BAD on campus, the list goes on.\n\nGetting back to my situation, my first year was online and EVERYONE cheated on EVERYTHING but I didn't know how to so I didn't and ended up with the lower side of decent kinda grades (mainly bc most of the syllabus was geared to start off from what was taught in the Indian curriculum that I obv didn't study and so there were large gaps in my knowledge that I wasn't even aware of). For detail, I averaged a 8.33\/10 CGPA.\n\nIn my 2nd year, we went irl, I got my shit together, worked super hard but bc there is literally no sense of fair grading and cheating is rampant at my uni, so my efforts have only given mediocre results. (I got a 8.73\/10 GPA in that sem, now averaging 8.46). This added with overwork (my uni is 6 days a week, 1 month holiday for summer, 1 week for winter, sometimes we do 7 days a week working and the semesters are back-to-back i.e. after the last day of sem 3, the next day is sem 4), I am super burned out rn with v low morale.\n\n**\\*** I've decided to transfer but I have a v weak application, I only focused on studying and I do computer science so I need projects\/stuff to appear as a suitable candidate. I am generally quiet and mainly focused on self-learning bc of my low-quality classes so my letter of recommendations is also super weak. Ofc i do have potential, i am smart, i am hard working, i am capable. But my situation for the past 2 years has been HORRENDOUS and unfortunately no uni is going to understand that. After all i go to a top10 uni, hundreds of fully capable candidates graduate from there every year and i am the only one making excuses.\n\n**\\*** My only other option is to drop out. But my main priority is to leave India bc I cannot live here on my own like i don't know the language or the customs, etc and unlike every other country i've lived in you can't just google get straight forward answers for things in India which is the only survival method i've learnt. Which basically means if I drop out, I would have to learn computer science on my own and get a job abroad and i've never heard of anyone do that or the prospects of that path so I am super unsure.\n\nThis post has been an absolute mess but if anyone could help i'd appreciate it so so much.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome to our session today!
