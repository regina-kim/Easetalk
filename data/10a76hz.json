I told them I can’t work 2 days specifically since those are the days I have class in community college. This is my second year in but feels like first since I completely bombed my first 2 semesters and I’m on probation now with no financial aid. Thankfully my parents are willing to help to an extent since they don’t have a lot of money either. \n\nI’m planning to take 4 courses this coming semester, 12 credits. 2 of them are replacement classes since I failed them before. \n\nBasically what I’m asking is working too much and taking 4 courses at a time rough? I prob know the answer since I’m asking myself this but I wanna know other opinions/options. I want to speed up my graduation process since I’m a transfer or at least trying to transfer but I want to finish community first with an associates",
