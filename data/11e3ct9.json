  "concern": "Hi so I was not at school basically the last 2 weeks due to family reasons, and my partner for an assignment said it’s fine and to just add whatever I have to the doc &amp; PowerPoint since I couldn’t meet up. We’re presenting on a chapter of a book we read in a couple hours and…I haven’t looked at the PowerPoint till I went to add my notes in last night and it’s all from cliff notes, spark notes and the first page of Google. Literally verbatim. What the shit am I supposed to do right now?\n\nUpdate**** \nForgot I posted this ngl\n\n1.) Thanks for the advice, I was able to get an extension to Thursday by coincidence. My teacher canceled class 15 minutes beforehand.\n\n2.) I didn’t abandon my partner to do the project alone, it’s a presentation on a book we’re reading in class and all of my information I put into a shared google doc. She didn’t give me access to the PowerPoint till the night before. Anyways, the family emergency was my mom needing a babysitter cause she was having a liver transplant and her original babysitter fell through so I was out of state for two weeks.",
