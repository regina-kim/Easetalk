  "concern": "As much as I like my work, I really fear my periods of break.  I am a CS grad student, so all of my works are done behind a few monitors.  Every time I take a break, whether it be for lunch or for once-in-hours break, once I start taking a break, I get so absorbed into it that I cannot get out of it. Most commonly, I watch YouTube videos (streams &amp; stuff) during breaks because I don't know what else to do during the break and I find this activity the most amusing.  I have tried using a timer, but I tend to give myself extra few minutes over and over, and eventually not stopping, ugh! I also heard having a regular schedule might help, but I'm not sure how to set a regular schedule given that my work only involves research (no workout, nada) and it's difficult to get out of break in the first place.\n\nI don't know if this is common, but I am the guy who gets immersed into work very quickly and likes to continue working straight, until my day's work gets to the end. Yes, I prefer work without breaks.  However, people say it's important to take breaks, and there is also some unskippable breaks like lunch and dinner.  What is the way to have a healthy break that does not break my work momentum?\n\nNow, some may recommend working out, but I unfortunately am a \"strong\" at-home person and doesn't really like working out.  I think break should be giving me some dopamine, but workout should give me near-zero dopamine, while YouTubing gives me enticingly high amount of dopamine. Ugh, any suggestions for me, folks?",
