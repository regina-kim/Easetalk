  "concern": "My university allowed a student religious organization on campus to invite a speaker to host an event. The speaker is outwardly and actively pro-conversion therapy and the vice chancellor states that they can’t do anything because of “freedom of speech” which obviously is something that can’t be infringed upon but this feels like bordering hate speech. I’m non-binary and very gay, and I feel very, very lost. \n\nI’m not sure what else can be done. Some news outlets I think are picking it up and protests are planned, but I feel kind of helpless. Any more tips for trying to fight this?\n\nEdit to answer some questions: the event is allegedly discussing LGBT issues that our generation is facing. I've looked at some of the speaker's speeches, and her website, and she very clearly talks about sex and gender being the same thing, how that wasn't God's original plan, how we're destroying his \"sweet language,\" that trans people aren't real, how it's all deception... etc. There is an LGBTQIA+ organization on campus, and they're leading the protest with the assistance of some local churches. \n\nI also realize that I may have used 'hate speech' incorrectly, and I do understand that despite how weird it is, it is protected under the First Amendment.",
