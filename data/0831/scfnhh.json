  "concern": "hi all! i have accommodations at my college and if you don’t know about those you should!! i have a documented disability (mental health related) that states i need a few extra steps to make college life easier.\n\n\n\nanyways, in order to put these into place you must visit your professor and discuss them with a letter from the coordinator and have them sign it, which i have done for all my classes except this one. last week was my first week back but i’m recovering from covid and the flu so i couldn’t attend but have went back yesterday. i attempted to find my professors office last week but had to go home from almost passing out and yesterday despite the posted hours, he wasn’t available in his office. so now i’m left with the biggest issue ever, how do i handle my preferential seating?!\n\n\n\nusually i sit closest to the door because i tend to leave the class at times for movement or if something goes bad in my head, but yesterday made me realize i can’t just sit wherever.\n\n\n\ni had talked to my professor before class and he let me know to sit wherever i need to so i did but i had a girl tell me i was in her spot and needed to move. there’s no assignees seating and i had gotten the go ahead from my prof but this still caught me off guard as i’m a very nervous person. i cant imagine telling someone they’re in my spot, and didn’t even do that in high school. there was a spot one over from me, and she ended up sitting in it anyways. i did let her know i have accommodations to sit where i need to and she walked away, but now i can’t say that because i haven’t talked to the prof.\n\n\n\nwe’re advised to only talk about accommodations outside of class and during office hours, but i’m getting extremely anxious for my class in two hours and my teacher only has office hours after. should i email? i know im not supposed to email about this but i’m not sure what to do when i’m told i’m in someone’s spot and i’m in the spot that works best for me. any advice? am i being dramatic? i want to say let’s all be adults but i’m the one refusing to get up from someone’s else’s spot lol",
