  "concern": "In a discord for a class I'm taking (freshman-level intro gen ed class, though I am not a freshman), several people both admitted to not taking notes during lectures and expressed surprise that I take notes by hand, in a paper notebook. \n\nIn this class, all of our tests are open note. This came up in the context of classmates feeling that they didn't do well on the test despite it being open note. I did well on the exam and found my notes to be very useful. \n\nI'm a non-traditional student and am now wondering if most gen z (or new high school grads, college freshmen, 18-19 year olds) students really don't take notes? Also wondering if maybe this is some of these folks' first time in a college-level course and this is the moment they are realizing that you have to take notes even if recorded zoom lectures etc. are available?",
