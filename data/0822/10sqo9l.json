  "concern": "So, good news: my STEM PhD defense date is coming up (\\~3 months), and I'm excited! I have a bit of data collection left to do, but it will be done by the end of this month, then I'll just be submitting papers, editing, preparing the dissertation and presentation, etc.. \n\nBad news: I'm really nervous about the questions. My oral quals went... okay, but it definitely could have gone better. There is one prof in particular, who is super knowledgeable and helpful, and I really respect their opinion. However, I've noticed that if you answer a question incorrectly, or don't know something they think you should know, they have a tendency to then really go in and ask way more intense questions. I know some people say it's okay to say you don't know... that has.. not been my experience with this professor. At one point I said I didn't know, and needed to look into something more, they got pretty frustrated with me and told me it was something I SHOULD know, and if I'm presenting it and don't know, that reflects badly on me. They were totally right, I really should have known the thing, honestly. BUT now I'm terrified I'll get asked something I don't know, knowing how it will go from there.\n\nAnyone have advice on how to anticipate/be prepared for as many questions as possible? How do I figure out what I don't know? For context, I feel well prepared in general, I'm proud of my projects. I am specifically worried about a repeat of the prior situation, where a question I just hadn't thought of throws me off and we spiral from there.",
