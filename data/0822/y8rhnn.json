  "concern": "Hi y'all. I (f22) am graduating next semester and I can't tell you how I regret every bit of it. The friends I made, the parties I went to, my poor mental health. It destroyed my trajectory. I can put some of the blame on the pandemic. After covid hit, I decided to take a semester off. I lost all my passion, didn't know what job I wanted, and was distracted by boys and friends and freedom. I didn't know I had undiagnosed depression and ADHD. I went back to school, but to a community college. Waste of time, all those classes meant nothing at a 4 year university. Refused to go back to my original school and went somewhere an hour away. I said it was for the instate tuition. I was really just scared of returning to a place I felt so depressed and lost when I was 18. When I finally returned to my original university, the one that actually had the best opportunities, I had wasted all that time. If I want to graduate on time, and I do, I can't indulge in all the opportunities.\n\nI messed up my academics, my friends, my health (mental and physical). Use me as an example and set school as a priority. Its something everyone tells you and everyone brushes it off. Well, surprise surprise. Should've listened.\n\nAny similar thoughts or feelings; whether it's over devotion to school or missed chances? Regret this large is new to me.",
