  "concern": "So, many of you are probably in the same boat as me. I am working on graduating by the end of the semester, but I am kind of shitting my pants with how much I have left to do. There's still enough time, I still control my destiny, but the time is fast approaching where we won't have enough time/ be pulling all nighters to get done. And working another job while wrapping up my PhD on the side, I CANNOT do that...\n\nI've set a goal to write 4 pages a day in February. Does anyone want to join me in this endeavor? If you write 4 pages (including today) from now until the end of the month, you have 88 pages. 3/4 to half of your dissertation. If you are doing a thesis that could be more than enough. I realize page count is kind of a stupid metric, but this is all fluid so do what's best for you. It could mean write more/less per day or switch to an editing goal. \n\nAnybody in? If so, let me know what your goal is and what you're writing about. If people want, I can post a new thread every Sunday. \n\nI am writing about tecno-economic implications of producing and selling non-electricity commodities from nuclear (hydrogen, clean water, etc). Goal is 4 pages per day average.",
