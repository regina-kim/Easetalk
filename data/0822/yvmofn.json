  "concern": "Hi all,\n\nI am an MBA student in the back half of my program with 4 classes left. I am in the second most challenging class in the degree supposedly at the moment, and while it is a lot of work it didn't seem tough when given the time at the beginning of the semester. The issue is, I haven't been able to put the time in to succeed and it is really hitting me mentally, I can't decide what to do at the moment. \n\nI recently lost both my great aunt and uncle (basically my grandparents, the closest people in my life outside of my immediate family) within two weeks of each other and have had to travel across the USA to support my family and be there as my aunt passed away at the end. For reference, my aunt and uncle lived in the northeast while my family is located in southern FL. My immediate family is extremely close and my mother has been away from the family providing care every step of the way in conjunction with Hospice, not leaving their side since her arrival there in early September. On top of this, my maternal grandparents and maternal uncle (who have been mentally abusive of my mother for my entire life, the reason we moved down south) have been treating the family terribly and causing additional stress for my family and quite frankly I don't know how my mother has been able to deal with this whole thing. My uncle is a troublemaker who has been enabled throughout his life by my grandparents and has been to jail a few times for various issues that should have landed him more time in lockup. The conflict this time is over the fact certain people were not included in the will, and my mom is being blamed for us having control of the estate. We had a bat by the door the whole time we were at my great aunt and uncle's house and all decided nobody is leaving mom alone and we needed to be ready in case he showed up to cause issues. \n\nI say all this to mention that while I stayed there (4 weeks) from the beginning of October to a few days ago, I had no access to the internet on the trip minus randomly stopping at a local community college to try and do some work one day for class. Essentially every waking moment I was there I was with the family and trying to provide support for my mom, and I lost track of this class and got so far behind that I feel like I can't claw my way back at this point. I can drop the course, but I feel as if I am an abject failure for doing so. I thought about dropping earlier in the trip but figured I'd be able to get back on track when we left, but we stayed longer than anticipated and I feel as if that isn't the case.\n\n I'm 26 and feel like I should be done with my degree already, I don't want to put myself back by a semester when I am nearing the finish line, but I'm not sure what to do. I haven't completely coped with the situation to this point and am just looking for some insights or perspective on this. I am planning on having a conversation over the phone with my professor on Thursday, and my advisor has mentioned I can get out of the class affecting my degree given the circumstances. It still just makes me feel like I'm screwing myself so hard and wasting time. \n\nSorry for being long-winded. \n\nGot any ways to deal with the guilt of potentially dropping a class, and have any advice?",
