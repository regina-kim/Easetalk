  "concern": "Hi everyone, \n\nIt's my first time posting here. \n\nI'm going into the third year of my PhD in a few weeks. I've been struggling with a pretty bad depression over the last couple of months and it's partially due to the loneliness and isolation that comes along with doctoral work/endlessly working by myself day in and day out. I've started to lose motivation and struggling with feelings of sadness most days. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips, coping strategies or advice for how to work through this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks to anyone who takes the time to reach out!",
