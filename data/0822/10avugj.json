Before I get into the details, I'll provide a bit of background.\n\nI'm currently a second and final year MSc Biology (2 yrs) international student in the Netherlands, and the way my program is designed, each year I am supposed to find an internship in order to progress and eventually graduate. The university recommends us to do the first internship in-house, meaning under the Faculty of Science and your respective department, only then for the second/last internship you get to choose to do the internship in a company or another university (company or university can be locally or internationally, students have the option). \n\nI successfully completed my first internship already back in September 2022 and ever since then have been stuck in a hole trying to find an internship here in western Europe. I have tried companies locally and several neighboring countries as well as universities (across the Netherlands) but my efforts have proven to be fruitless thus far. Companies either do not reply or that they are not hiring during this period. In the meantime, I have just been calling and sending emails on a daily basis, even spoke to my program/study advisor who gave me useful advice and suggestions but still nothing to show. Hell, I have even tried approaching/connecting with potential employers via Linkedin after receiving such advice but apparently for some I require the premium package, which I do not have, in order to send them a message\n\nI feel like a failure because it's now January 2023 and due to my internship being a mandatory 6-month period in order to get the credits, this all means that I will definitely be graduating late. That, in turn, means more burden on my parents to financially support me. I just don't know what to do when the companies and the people I send my emails to do not reply at all.",
