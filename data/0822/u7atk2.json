Do you think starting with something small, like updating my name on social media or email signatures, could work as a test run? I’m also wondering if I should talk to my advisor about this to get their take, since they know my career situation pretty well.\ntherapist: It's great that you're considering taking a small step, like updating your social media or email signature, to test the waters and see how it feels. That could be a gentle way to start integrating your new name into your life without feeling overwhelmed. And reaching out to your advisor for their perspective could provide valuable insight into how your professional circle might respond. Remember, you're not obligated to make any big decisions right now—you're just exploring possibilities and gathering information to inform your choices. What would it be like for you to take that first step, even if it's just a small one?\nclient: Thanks for affirming that a small step is a good way to start—I’m feeling a bit more confident about trying something low-key. Honestly, taking that first step, like changing my social media or email signature, feels a little scary but also exciting, like I’m finally doing something that matches how I see myself, even if it’s just in a small way.\n\nI think it’d be a relief to dip my toe in and see how people react without committing fully yet. I’m just wondering, though, how I’d explain it if someone asks why I’ve got a different name popping up in some places but not others—do you think I need a solid script for that, or should I just keep it casual and play it by ear? Also, talking to my advisor still feels a bit daunting; I trust them, but I’m not sure how to bring it up without it sounding like I’m distracted from my defense. Any thoughts on how to approach that convo without it feeling like a big deal?\ntherapist: That's a great point about wanting to be prepared if someone notices the name change. Maybe you could have a simple, casual response ready, like, \"\"I'm trying out a new name that feels more like me, and I'm starting with personal spaces,\"\" which keeps it low-key but still honest. As for talking to your advisor, you could frame it as something that helps you focus on your defense by resolving a personal distraction, like, \"\"I've been considering a name change and wanted to check in about how to manage that smoothly while finishing my work.\"\" That way, it shows you're proactive about balancing both.\nclient: Thanks for the suggestions on how to phrase things—that casual response for if someone asks feels doable and not too heavy. I like the idea of framing the convo with my advisor as something that helps me stay focused; it makes it less about a big personal reveal and more about tying up loose ends.\n\nI think I’ll start with updating my email signature or maybe a personal social media account and see how that sits with me. I’m still a bit nervous about even a small change, though—like, what if I get pushback or weird questions I’m not ready for? Do you think I should just expect some awkwardness and roll with it, or is there a way to prep more for those kinds of reactions? And with my advisor, should I just shoot them a quick email to set up a chat, or wait until I’ve got a bit more clarity on what I’m doing?\ntherapist: It's normal to feel nervous about potential reactions, and it's good that you're thinking ahead. Having a simple, casual explanation ready, like the one we discussed earlier, can help you feel more prepared. As for your advisor, you could send them a quick email to set up a chat and mention that you'd like to discuss a personal matter that might impact your work. This way, you can approach the conversation with clarity and confidence.\nclient: Thanks for the reassurance—it helps to know that feeling nervous is just part of the process. I’ll stick with that simple explanation for now and try to keep it light if anyone asks questions.\n\nI think I’ll draft a quick email to my advisor soon, just to get the ball rolling, though I’m still a little unsure how much detail to give upfront. Do you think I should keep the email super vague, like just asking for a quick chat about a personal thing, or hint at the name change idea so they’re not totally caught off guard? Also, if I do start with something small like my email signature, should I let my close lab mates know first so they’re not surprised, or just let it happen naturally? I don’t want to overthink it, but I also don’t want to deal with a bunch of confusion right before my defense.\ntherapist: It's totally understandable to want to find that balance between being prepared and not overcomplicating things. Maybe you could hint at the name change in the email to your advisor, like saying you'd like to discuss a personal matter that might affect your professional identity. This way, they're not caught off guard, but you're still keeping it low-key.\nAs for your lab mates, you could start by letting a few close ones know ahead of time so they're not surprised, but also give yourself permission to just let it happen naturally with others. That way, you're taking control where you feel comfortable, but also allowing for some flexibility.\nclient: Thanks, that makes sense—hinting at it in the email feels like a good middle ground without dumping the whole thing on them at once. I’ll probably just say something quick about a personal matter tied to my professional identity, like you suggested, and keep the rest for the actual chat.\n\nWith my lab mates, I think I’ll tell a couple of the closer ones first, just to have some support in case anyone else reacts weirdly. I guess I’m still a bit worried about the timing with my defense coming up—do you think I should hold off on any changes, even small ones, until after I defend, or is it okay to start now as long as I keep it minimal? I just don’t want this to turn into a distraction when I’ve got so much on my plate already.\ntherapist: Thanks for being open and thoughtful about your concerns. I think it's great that you're considering starting with small, manageable changes, like updating your email signature or telling a few close lab mates. These actions can help you build confidence and test the waters without overwhelming yourself or others. As for the timing, you might want to ask yourself how long it would take to make these small changes and how much mental energy they'll require. If they're quick and relatively low-effort, it could be a good way to start the process while still having your focus on your defense. Just remember, you can always pause or adjust if you feel overwhelmed. Take it one step at a time, and trust that you're doing what feels right for you.\nclient: Thanks for breaking it down like that—it helps to think about the energy these changes might take. I’ll probably start with something small like the email signature soon, as long as it doesn’t feel like too much with my defense prep, and just see how it goes from there. \n\nI guess I’m still wondering if there’s a way to gauge how much of a distraction this could be before I jump in. Do you have any tips on how to check in with myself about that, or should I just trust my gut and adjust as needed?\ntherapist: To help gauge potential distractions and stay on track, consider these self-check strategies:\n1. **Time commitment:** Track how much time you spend on name change tasks each day. If it consistently takes more than 10-15 minutes, it might be a distraction.\n2. **Emotional energy:** Notice how you feel after making a change, like updating your email signature. If you feel more confident and calm, it’s likely a positive step. If it leaves you feeling anxious or drained, it might be better to pause and reassess.\n3. **Progress checks:** Schedule short weekly check-ins with yourself to review your defense preparations and name change progress. If you notice your defense prep is suffering, consider pausing the name change process temporarily.\nRemember, it’s essential to trust your instincts and adjust as needed. Your defense is a priority, but taking small, manageable steps toward your personal goals can also contribute to your overall well-being.\nclient: Thanks for laying out those strategies—they sound really practical and doable. I’ll start by tracking my time and feelings like you suggested, and make sure I’m not letting this pull me too far from my defense focus.\n\nI think having those weekly check-ins with myself could help keep me grounded. Do you think it’s worth jotting down a quick note during those check-ins, just to keep track of how I’m feeling, or is thinking it through enough?",
