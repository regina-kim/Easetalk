The advantages would be that we would have similar interests, be in similar circumstances (convenience), and could study together. Alternatively, it might be nice to live with people different from the people I study with and maintain a little professional distance. What did you do and what were your experiences?\n\nIf I live with other grad students outside my cohort, should I focus on finding other PhD students, other first years, or would it not matter?\n\nOf course, I can move after the first year once I settle in and meet new people.",
