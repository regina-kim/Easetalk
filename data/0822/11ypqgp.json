  "concern": "Hey all! I saw that people can help. So I’m going to try this too!\n\nI am 24 and still in college. I started in 2016 and took some time off to battle depression. Although it was tough, I won eventually. I decided to go back in 2021 and I have been doing well until now. I find myself questioning the reason I’m here all the time. I don’t know what my ‘Why’ or my true purpose is. I don’t care about being my age in college because how others view me doesn’t matter. I believe that I will finish, I think? If I were not in college, I don’t know what I would be doing with myself but working at a soul sucking job. I am having trouble matching actions with my words and thoughts. I haven’t been studying consistently and I sometimes avoid classes. I am on academic probation again and I just don’t understand why I continue to self sabotage when I claim that I am confident and want to be a college graduate. \n\nI even try to better myself with reading self-help books, talking to my support system, and be more outgoing on campus like joining clubs and going to parties. Parties are played out to me and the clubs are going okay. Atomic habits, reinventing the habit wheel, and meditation have all helped me in short bursts, but I still am having trouble getting my sh*t together. I am starting to feel hopeless. I don’t want to feel hopeless ever again. Last time I felt that way I was deeply depressed. I want to be better than this. How can fight against my negative emotions? How can be more consistent with the things that will better myself? How can I win the war against my mind and body? Any suggestions please?",
