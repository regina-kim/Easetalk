  "concern": "TW: self harm \n\nI am a 5th year in college who is non-traditional student aged. I was previously academically dismissed and worked so hard to get back into my college and I did! The community college classes I took in the time between was so easy and I didn’t really learn to cultivate better habits as I was able to quickly do work and still get As, which felt good, but not the same at a 4 year college. I have been diagnosed with ADHD/ anxiety/ depression since the 5th grade and didn’t start utilizing accommodations until high school. Used them and did great. College is another story as I started to having to advocate for myself and thought all of my negative symptoms were how everyone felt and who I was. I never saw those things as barriers, but as I have gotten older, the dots have started clicking. I have been embarrassed to use my accommodations until this year because past friends made comments that it’s unfair and I took those to heart. The academic resource center purged my files upon my dismissal so it’s been a mess trying to get the correct documentation and my doctor only sent in the documentation last week even though I was asking for months. I am very frustrated as I’ve been falling behind due to my mental health rapidly declining this semester upon starting a new medication that made everything worse: insomnia, more anxiety, not taking care of myself, thoughts of unaliving myself, and started c*tting myself for a few weeks. I started to make the connection that it was my new med I started and then cut it cold Turkey and have felt better, but I’m still in a disassociative state making functioning hard. I am scared to disclose all of this as I can’t afford to medically withdraw and am supposed to graduate in the spring. I would appreciate any advice for how to handle this",
