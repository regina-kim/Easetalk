  "concern": "So I got my MA in History in May, 2021, from a terminal program - but I wasn't accepted to any of the PhD programs I applied to, my advisor and I were pretty sure, because of all the schools in 2020-21 who froze PhD admissions altogether to conserve funding for current students during the pandemic causing a snowball effect that everyone who applied to those schools (i.e Cornell) to apply to other schools they wouldn't have initially. \n\nSo here I am, unemployed because minimum wage places won't hire me (\"Overqualified\") and without the certification to teach history in a high school or do anything with my degree applying to PhD programs again. In the time since the last admissions round, I've signed a deal with a publisher to publish my MA thesis as a book, which is due out in June, but hasn't been listed for pre-order or sale anywhere yet to prove that it's real to admission committees and not just a CV invention, so I'm worried that won't be enough to give me a leg up in admissions. My MA GPA was a 4.0, but my undergrad GPA was absolutely awful. \n\nI have received one email from a member of an admissions committee from one of the schools I applied to asking whether \"the retirement of \\[a professor I had expressed interest in working in\\] would affect whether or not you choose to attend\" that school. \n\nAm I panicking unnecessarily? Has the worry about conserving money for existing students let up at various universities? Do I just need to take a xanax and relax until March when I'll hear yes or no definitively?",
