I need to decide whether to live in a dorm or to commute.\n\nHere are the details:\n\nCost:\n   - Dorming would cost around $40,000.\n   - Commuting would cost around $20,000.\n\nProgram Participation: I’ve been accepted into a program called the RLC, which offers leadership opportunities and event planning experience. Being part of this program would enhance my transcript significantly, especially if I plan to transfer later. However, participation requires living on campus.\n\nPersonal Growth: I also want the opportunity to grow in a different environment, which living on campus could provide.\n\nLocation: I live only 10 minutes away from the university by car, making commuting a feasible option.\n\nI’m feeling uncertain about which option is best for me and would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer.\n",
