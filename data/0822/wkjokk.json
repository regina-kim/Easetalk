I’m kinda overwhelmed thinking about juggling everything and making sure I don’t mess up this chance I’ve got.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're really putting a lot of pressure on yourself, and I can see why that would feel overwhelming. What's been on your mind lately when you think about starting college again?\nclient: Man, it’s just everything piling up in my head. I keep wondering if I’m even cut out for this after being out of the game for so long.\ntherapist: You've been through a lot of changes already, and it's natural to feel uncertain about this next step. Can you tell me more about what's been making you question whether you're cut out for college after your time in the Navy?\nclient: Honestly, it’s just this nagging feeling that I might not be able to keep up with the pace or the workload after being away from academics for so long. I’m worried I’ve forgotten how to study or that I won’t fit in with the other students who seem so much younger.\n\nLike, I’ve been through tough stuff in the Navy, so I know I can handle pressure, but this feels different, you know? I guess I’m scared that I’ve changed too much to just slide back into being a student, and I don’t want to let myself down after taking this huge leap. What do you think I can do to kinda ease into this without feeling like I’m drowning from day one?\ntherapist: It’s clear that you have a strong foundation of resilience from your time in the Navy, and while this new challenge might feel different, those skills you’ve developed—like handling pressure and adapting to change—can definitely be an asset in navigating college life. Maybe we could start by exploring some small steps you can take to gradually build confidence in your ability to keep up with the workload, such as connecting with a study group or seeking guidance from a counselor who specializes in supporting veterans in higher education.\nclient: Hey, that actually sounds pretty doable, and I hadn’t really thought about leaning on other vets or study groups for support. I guess I’m just nervous, but breaking it down into smaller steps like that might help me not feel so overwhelmed right off the bat.\n\nSo, like, how do I even find these groups or counselors who get what I’m going through? I mean, I don’t even know where to start looking for people who’ve been in my shoes.\ntherapist: Here’s a supportive response:\nThat’s a great question, and I’m glad you’re open to exploring those resources! Many colleges and universities have dedicated support services for veterans, including peer mentorship programs, study groups, and counselors who specialize in helping vets transition to campus life. We could start by looking into those options together, or I can guide you through some ways to connect with other veterans who might be going through similar experiences.\nclient: Cool, I’d really appreciate the help with figuring out where to look for those resources. I didn’t even realize colleges might have specific stuff for vets, so that’s a relief to hear. \n\nI guess I’m just worried about feeling out of place even in those groups, you know? Like, what if I still don’t click with anyone or I’m the only one struggling this much?\ntherapist: It’s completely normal to feel apprehensive about connecting with others, especially when you’re going through a major transition. However, remember that these groups exist specifically to help veterans navigate similar challenges, and you might be surprised by how many people understand your concerns. Even if you don’t immediately find someone who shares your exact experience, the support and guidance from others who've been through similar transitions can make a big difference. Would you like me to help you find a few resources to get started?\nclient: Yeah, I’d really appreciate any help you can give with finding those resources. I just want to feel like I’m not totally alone in this, you know?\n\nI mean, it’s reassuring to hear that other vets might get where I’m coming from, but I still can’t shake this fear of sticking out or not being on the same page as everyone else. Like, what if I’m overthinking everything and making it harder than it needs to be?\ntherapist: It’s understandable to feel uncertain about how you’ll fit in, but remember that many veterans share similar concerns about transitioning to college life. You might be surprised by how much common ground you find with others in those groups. Let’s start by exploring a few resources together, and we can take it from there—one small step at a time.\nclient: Thanks, I’m definitely up for checking out those resources with you. I just hope I can get past this nagging feeling of being different or overcomplicating things in my head.\n\nHonestly, I think part of me is still stuck on proving I made the right call by coming back to school. Like, I keep second-guessing if I’m cut out for this after being out of the game for so long.\ntherapist: It's great that you're open to exploring resources, and I'm here to support you in that journey. One step at a time, we can work together to find the right fit for you. Remember, you're not alone in this—many veterans have successfully transitioned to college life, and you can too. Let's focus on finding those resources first, and then we can talk about strategies to build confidence and overcome any doubts you may have.\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate having someone in my corner to help with this. I’m ready to start looking into those resources and see what’s out there.\n\nI guess I just keep worrying about whether I can actually keep up with everything, you know? Like, balancing school and life after being in such a different environment for so long feels like a huge hurdle.\ntherapist: It's completely natural to feel overwhelmed by the idea of balancing school and life, especially after being in a different environment for so long. However, remember that you've already taken the first step by being open to exploring resources, and we can work together to find strategies to help you navigate this transition. One small step at a time, we'll build a plan that works for you.\nclient: Thanks for understanding where I’m coming from—it helps to know I’m not just spinning my wheels here. I’m eager to work on that plan with you and figure out how to make this all manageable.\n\nMan, I just can’t help but feel like I’ve got so much catching up to do, especially with the way things have probably changed since I was last in school. Like, I’m worried I’ll be totally out of my depth with tech or just the way classes work now.\ntherapist: It's normal to feel like you're playing catch-up, especially with the rapid changes in technology and education. We can start by exploring resources that specifically address these concerns, such as tech workshops or orientation programs for returning students. Which area would you like to focus on first—technology or class structure?\nclient: Thanks for breaking it down like that—I’m glad there are specific resources to help with this stuff. I think I’d like to start with technology, since I feel like that’s where I’m most behind and it’s probably gonna be a big part of everything. \n\nI mean, back in the Navy, we had our own systems, but I’m not sure how much of that translates to school stuff. I just don’t wanna look like a total dinosaur in front of everyone, you know?\ntherapist: It’s totally understandable to feel that way, especially when transitioning from such a structured environment like the Navy. Let’s start by looking into tech workshops that can help bridge that gap and make you feel more confident in your abilities. You've got this!\nclient: Thanks, I’m really glad to hear there are workshops to help with that—it makes me feel a bit less like I’m starting from scratch. I just wanna get a handle on the basics so I don’t stick out too much, you know?\n\nMan, I keep thinking about how different this whole setup is compared to what I’m used to. Like, in the Navy, everything was so laid out, and now I feel like I’ve gotta figure out every little thing on my own.\ntherapist: That's a common adjustment to make when moving from a structured environment to a more flexible one. It's important to remember that you have the ability to adapt and navigate this new environment. We can work together to identify resources and strategies that will help you feel more confident and prepared for the academic setting. Let's continue to build on the progress we've made and tackle each challenge one step at a time.\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate the reminder that I can adapt—it helps to hear that. I’m definitely up for working on those strategies with you to get more comfortable with all this.\n\nSo, um, I guess I’m just wondering how long you think it might take to feel like I’ve got a good grip on things? I know it’s probably different for everyone, but I’m just trying to get a sense of what to expect.\ntherapist: Great question! Everyone’s adaptation timeline is unique, and it’s important to be patient with yourself. Think of it like learning a new language—some phrases might click right away, while others take time to master. You’ve already made progress by acknowledging your concerns and seeking support, which is a huge step. As we continue to work together, you’ll develop the tools and strategies to navigate this new environment with confidence. Let’s keep our focus on small, manageable goals and celebrate your progress along the way. You’re capable of this, and I’m here to support you every step of the way.\nclient: Thanks for putting it in perspective like that—it helps to think of it as a process I can work through step by step. I’m definitely on board with focusing on those smaller goals.\n\nHey, before we wrap up, do you think it’d be cool to check in a bit more often for the next few weeks? I just feel like having that extra support might keep me on track while I’m getting used to everything.\ntherapist: Great idea! Checking in more frequently will help you stay on track and provide ongoing support during this transition period. Let's schedule a follow-up session for next week, and we'll adjust as needed from there. Remember, you're not alone in this journey. I'm here to support you every step of the way, and together, we'll work through any challenges that arise.
