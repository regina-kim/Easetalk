  "concern": "I have recently started my Masters and I am having a really hard time working with my PI. \nShe’s very controlling, nit picking of everything I do and nothing that I do is ever enough for her.  I have been going above and beyond to do my experiments and also help out at the lab because it’s only me there. No lab technician or other students just me, so I do my experiments plus I also clear out the lab and make sure everything is in order. \nMy problem now is that my main experiment has been failing I can’t seem to yield any results, and when I ask her for help she tells me I need to think on my own and when she tries to help she ends up yelling at me and putting me really down. \n\nI go home everyday after the lab and cry; she’s been really affecting my mental health. \n\nI have been thinking about reaching out to my co-supervisor to see if I could work in their lab for a while but I’m not sure if I should do this behind her back. Or ever reaching out to my thesis advisory committee but once again idk if I should go behind her back or talk to her about it first. \n\nIf anyone can give me some advice that would be greatly appreciated thank you !!",
