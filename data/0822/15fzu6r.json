  "concern": "So I'm (21F) a first year in MBA (post grad) and my bachelors was in science. Its been a month since my course started and I had been enjoying it, despite the immense work load and studying.\n\nJust academic pressure was ok with me, I'm used to it. However recently they started interviews for student committees and clubs which took a toll on me because my midterm exams are in 2 days and these clubs are all making us do complicated and time consuming tasks right before the exam. \n\nI'm a bit of a perfectionist, so when the club I really wanted to join initially, asked us to submit like 10 documents including videos, budgeting plan, etc etc all within 10 hours, I got really stressed out, thinking that my whole day and night will go into this and I'll not be able to study for my exams.\n\nI wanted to do the best in both. But I realised that if I attempt to do the best in the club activity, my exams will suffer, and vice versa. I'm required to study more than other students because I come from a Science background so it's difficult to understand commerce related subjects. I ended up getting a terrible headache, chills, fever, and by the night I was not in a state to finish anything and was crying like a fool.\n\nI dropped out of the selection process for all clubs because in the end I felt like academics are more important for me and not something I can sacrifice for clubs that only host events n stuff. \n\nNow its morning, the next day, and I feel better and relaxed because now my only focus is studying. \n\nMy peers told me that joining clubs is not necessary, and that I can do other extra-curriculars and spend my time in getting the most knowledge I can, learning new skills, and participating in competitons.\n\nWas there anything wrong with what I did? I felt like I lacked management skills and ended up getting stressed, which made me think that different people have different capacity, but that felt like a limiting mindset, that I'm incapable of managing both activities at once.\n\nActually it was my inability to give my 100% in both areas that made me anxious to this extent.\n\nWhat do you guys suggest? Please help.",
