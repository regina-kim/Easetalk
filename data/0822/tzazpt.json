  "concern": "I’m in a History MA program (graduating in May!) and it’s been a big struggle but the worst part is the complete lack of standard expectations.\n\nOver the summer (2021) all of my cohort had to do an internship. At the end of the internship we had to write a reflection essay about our experiences. However, this essay is reviewed by our advisor and depending on what they want the essays are very different. Most were 4-5 pages with a lot of self-reflection, one or two people got away with 1-2 pages. \n\nBut my advisor (who only has me as an advisee as they are on sabbatical) asked for a ten page paper which they have  returned FOUR  times for more editing. This most recent return they are asking me to add at least four paragraphs were I explain some books related to the internship topic, what their main points were, and how I felt those were reflected in my internship. No one else in my cohort was asked to do this but since I need advisor approval I am stuck adding all their demands. I’m the last one still working on this essay.\n\nAlso it needs to be submitted before the 21st so I can graduate so on top of finishing my capstone, regular work for class, and helping a sick family member, I have to work on this stupid essay. My advisor is completely aware of all of this too. And since they are on sabbatical it can be up to a month before I get a response. I’m just so frustrated!!!!",

Could we schedule a time to discuss any remaining concerns or revisions?\"\" This way, you're showing your commitment while also opening the door for a productive conversation.\nRegarding your scattered feelings, it might help to take a moment to assess which tasks are truly urgent versus which ones can wait. Try asking yourself, \"\"Which task will have the most significant impact if completed first?\"\" or \"\"Which task can I realistically complete within the next few hours or days?\"\" By prioritizing based on these questions, you'll be able to focus your energy on the most critical tasks and make steady progress without feeling overwhelmed.\nclient: Thanks for the suggestion on how to frame things with my advisor—that wording feels way less confrontational, and I think I can work with that. I’m just nervous about even getting a response in time with how slow they’ve been, but I’ll give it a try and see if I can get some clarity.\n\nAnd yeah, figuring out what’s most urgent makes sense, though honestly, everything feels like it’s screaming at me right now. I guess I can try to list out my tasks and pick one or two to focus on each day—like maybe start with the essay revisions since that’s tied to my graduation—but I’m still kinda overwhelmed just thinking about it all. How do I keep myself from spiraling when I look at that list and feel like there’s no way I can get it all done?\ntherapist: It’s okay to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of tasks. You don’t have to tackle everything at once. Let’s focus on one or two tasks for the day, and remember that every step you take, no matter how small, is progress. When you start to spiral, take a deep breath and remind yourself that you’re doing the best you can. It’s also important to practice self-compassion and acknowledge that it’s normal to feel this way when you’re juggling so much. You’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to ask for help when you need it.\nclient: Thanks for reminding me to take it one step at a time—I really needed to hear that. I’ll try to focus on just a couple things each day and keep telling myself it’s okay if I don’t get everything done right away.\n\nI guess I’m just scared that even if I break it down, I’ll still fall behind, especially with my advisor’s slow responses. It’s like I’m trying to stay on top of stuff, but there’s always something out of my control messing things up. How do I deal with that frustration when it feels like no matter what I do, I’m still stuck waiting or stressing?\ntherapist: It’s understandable to feel frustrated when things are out of your control, but remember that you can still focus on the things you can control, like your own work and communication. It might help to reframe your mindset from seeing these delays as roadblocks to seeing them as opportunities to work on other tasks or take a break to recharge. Remember, progress is progress, no matter how slow it may seem. Keep in mind that you’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to ask for help when you need it.\nclient: Thanks for pointing that out—I hadn’t thought about using the waiting time as a chance to focus on other stuff or just take a breather. I’ll try to shift my thinking and see if that helps with the frustration.\n\nI’m just still kinda stuck on how to not let the waiting stress me out, you know? Like, I get that I can work on other things, but in the back of my mind, I’m always worrying about whether I’ll hear back in time or if I’m gonna miss some deadline. How do I quiet that nagging voice that keeps freaking me out about stuff I can’t control?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're already making progress by acknowledging the waiting time as an opportunity to focus on other tasks or take a break. Remember that it's normal to feel some level of stress or worry when waiting for responses, but try to remind yourself that you've done your part by reaching out and communicating your needs. \nInstead of letting the nagging voice take over, try to acknowledge the worry and gently refocus your attention on what you can control. For example, you could say to yourself, \"\"I've done what I can for now, and I'll revisit this concern when I receive a response.\"\" This can help quiet the worrying thoughts and allow you to move forward with the tasks at hand.\nclient: Thanks for the tip on acknowledging the worry and redirecting my focus—I think that could really help with calming that constant nagging in my head. I’ll try telling myself I’ve done what I can and just let it be for now.\n\nIt’s just hard to not keep checking my email every five minutes, you know? Like, I’m so anxious about missing something or not having enough time to fix stuff if my advisor finally gets back to me. How do I stop myself from obsessing over that and actually focus on other things?\ntherapist: One approach could be to set a specific time to check your email, maybe once or twice a day, and try to avoid checking it outside of those times. This can help break the cycle of constant checking and reduce the anxiety that comes with it. You could also try setting up notifications or reminders for when you need to check your email, so you can focus on other tasks without worrying about missing something important.\nclient: Thanks for the idea of setting specific times to check my email—that sounds like it could really help me stop obsessing over it. I’ll try to pick a couple of times a day and stick to that instead of constantly refreshing.\n\nI’m just worried that even with a schedule, I’ll still be thinking about it, you know? Like, what if I’m in the middle of working on something else and I just can’t shake the thought that I might be missing a crucial reply? How do I train myself to let go of that urge to keep checking just in case?\ntherapist: That's a valid concern, and it's important to acknowledge those thoughts without judgment. One strategy could be to create a \"\"worry journal\"\" or a \"\"concern list\"\" where you write down the thoughts and worries that pop up throughout the day. This can help you acknowledge and process those thoughts without letting them interrupt your focus. You could also try pairing this with a grounding exercise, like deep breathing or a quick mindfulness meditation, to help calm your mind and bring your attention back to the present moment.\nclient: Thanks for suggesting the worry journal and grounding exercises—that sounds like a practical way to get those nagging thoughts out of my head without letting them take over. I’ll definitely give that a shot and see if writing stuff down helps me feel less stuck on it.\n\nI guess I’m also just feeling kinda overwhelmed with how much is on my plate right now, you know? Like, even if I manage to stop obsessing over the email, I’ve still got so many other things piling up that it’s hard to know where to start. How do I even begin to prioritize when everything feels urgent?\ntherapist: One strategy to help you prioritize when everything feels urgent is to use the Eisenhower Matrix, which categorizes tasks into four quadrants based on their urgency and importance. This can help you identify which tasks are truly urgent and important, and which ones can be delegated, postponed, or eliminated. You can also try using a task list or planner to break down your tasks into smaller, manageable steps and focus on completing one step at a time.\nclient: Thanks for bringing up the Eisenhower Matrix and the idea of breaking tasks into smaller steps—that sounds like a solid way to get a handle on things. I’ll try mapping out what’s most urgent and important to see if that helps me feel less buried.\n\nI just keep feeling like no matter how I organize stuff, there’s not enough time in the day, you know? Like, I’m juggling so much that even the idea of sitting down to prioritize feels like another task on the list. How do I deal with that sinking feeling that I’m always gonna be behind?\ntherapist: I understand your frustration, and it's important to remember that managing your workload and prioritizing tasks is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. Be patient with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.
