  "concern": "My PhD application this year had some serious weaknesses - the majority of my research experience is clinical (little lab experience), my research is in endocrinology and pharmacology (not related to desired field of neuroscience), all three letters of rec were from the same organization, zero publications. I was accepted to the University of Utah BME PhD program (by some miracle), but I'm torn on whether to take another gap year or if I should take this opportunity since there's no guarantee I'd be admitted again next year. \n\nIf I do another gap year, I would have a minimum of three publications (I've got 3-4 that should be published by June), I would spend the year working as an RA in a lab in my desired field, and obtain letters of rec from three different organizations now that I've built stronger relationships. I REALLY LIKE the program at Utah, but I don't LOVE it and I would hate not giving it another go at a few programs that I LOVE. However, the thought of turning down such an awesome and unexpected offer has me kicking myself. There's no guarantee I'll get accepted to Utah again (or anywhere for that matter) next year, so would it be foolish to turn down the offer? I just need to hear different opinions on the matter. I'm only 21 so I know I don't need to be in any hurry, but what are the potential downsides to another gap year?\n\nThank you!",

For example, you could say something like, \"\"I'm really excited about the opportunity to join the BME program at Utah, but I also have a strong passion for neuroscience and I'm interested in exploring how I might be able to incorporate that into my research and coursework. I'd love to hear about your experiences and any advice you might have for someone in my position.\"\" This approach shows that you're serious about the program while also being open about your interests and goals.\nclient: Thanks, that framing really helps. I like how it keeps things positive and shows I’m serious about Utah while still being upfront about my interests. I’ll definitely use that approach when I reach out. I’m feeling a bit more confident about this step now—do you think there’s anything else I should keep in mind before I start emailing or talking to people there?",
