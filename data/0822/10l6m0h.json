  "concern": "To make it clear right off the bat, the structure of my prelims for my program is this:\n\n- Preliminary Written Exam: Proposal of your dissertation research (written with committee input)\n\n- Preliminary Oral Exam: Defense of this prepared research proposal in front of committee. \n\nExtra info: I have a study that is funded/approved by my advisor already in the works that is a key part of what would be my dissertation. However, data capture will be half-done by the time I even get to do my prelims. Advisor helped write this study proposal, so he is aware of it. \n\nSo! My question: how did you go about writing your preliminary defense/proposal? Or, how did you just get over that initial getting started hump?\n\nI find myself unsure how to begin putting this together. My advisor left on sabbatical and I only found out last week so I'm feeling a little lost in the sauce already. I think I just need to wade in, but every time I try I end up drowning and psyching myself out more.",
