I hoped to work with them in the future and worked more in their subjects where I had the best grades.\n\nThese persons are now less rude against me but I feel so bad about this, I am so deeply hurt and I can't focus on my lectures with them anymore without thinking about what happened.\n\nThese persons are the one who gave me interest in the degree I'm pursuing and I'm not even feeling good about my own degree anymore, I'me even doubting my career.\n\nI am old for my cohort as I had a lot of issues in the past with my disability and health and these people are the one who gave me a second chance and now it went like this. I don't think I can change to another degree or start over. But it hurts me to continue. I have only these persons in lectures now, and I feel bad spending 20h a week with them and working on their things and so on.\n\nI'm absolutely lost, I don't know what to do. I fear reaching out, I fear telling them how I feel about what happened, I feel like giving up.",
