  "concern": "I am currently a college student. Whenever I have to send an email/chat message to my professors or classmates about school-related stuff (e.g. questions about school works, needing follow up for certain decisions on group activities) I always feel so stressed to the point where it's eating me up inside. I overthink about what my response should be for hours, and make several email/message drafts until I waste so much time. I am afraid that I might be sending them too many messages or that I might use the wrong words/phrases, and they end up finding me irritating. However, I also feel like I have to send them a message/email (sometimes even more than once for situations like asking follow up questions, or asking for clarification) to be sure about certain things. What do you guys do when you're in this situation?",
