  "concern": " A blurb on my situation and why I’m asking this: I’m currently in my school’s business program (includes majors in finance, economics, info sys, marketing, etc) with the aim of graduating with a bachelors in management information systems, however calculus has been a major roadblock for me.   \nI barely passed precalculus at a cc the first time I took it, failed calculus at the cc, then had to retake precalculus due to credit issues when transferring but failed it this time, and now I’ll need to take calculus again at a cc, and I have little hope that I’ll pass. I have a deadline to pass that class this next semester and if I don’t I’ll be kicked from the business program and won’t have access to any of the above listed majors. Already the prospects of having a nice info sys job are starting to dim. The only major I can think of that will allow me to not take calculus and graduate in a reasonable time is interdisciplinary studies. My remaining classes until I graduate would be poli sci because why not, I think it’s an interesting subject and there’d be no point to taking my remaining business or finance or information systems classes if I can’t have that major at the end of it.  \n\n\n..  \n\n\nTl;dr I suck at calculus  \n\n\nSo basically what my two questions are: will I be stuck working minimum wage jobs with the degree in the title or is there some hope for a “normal” working-in-an-office job?  \nWhat are some jobs that are open to both business and political science majors (because I’m assuming that’s where I’d most likely be heading with this plan)?",
