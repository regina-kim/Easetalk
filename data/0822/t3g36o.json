I would appreciate any tips, resources, breathing exercises, cartoons to play in the background, literally anything to help me focus and snap out of my dissociated state. I have been mostly focused on organizing, going to protests, donations, support, contacting friends and family and other things I can do at a distance, but I feel myself burning out and I still need to work. I informed my PI about the situation and my mental state, but I don’t expect him to be too understanding and he has left me on read so far (lol). I don’t have access to a psychologist unfortunately as there are huge waiting lists, but I have been trying. I just feel this huge cloud hanging over my head and it’s hard not to feel utterly devastated, although I am trying to keep my spirits to support others.\n\nedit: I’ve edited the post to reflect the fact that I am talking about the stress I’m feeling about the current war Russia is waging in Ukraine, not sure if it was clear.",

Perhaps we could explore ways to build in brief check-ins with a friend or short breaks that still keep you connected to your goals, like a quick walk around the block or a few deep breaths while standing up. What do you think might work best for you when you feel like procrastination is creeping in?\nclient: I think a quick walk around the block could be a good idea when I feel procrastination sneaking in—it might help clear my head without taking up too much time. I’m just not sure if I’ll actually do it when I’m in that headspace, so maybe pairing it with something I already do, like grabbing a coffee, could make it stick, you know?\ntherapist: That's a clever way to integrate the walk into your routine! Maybe you could even set a reminder for your coffee break, so it becomes a natural cue to take that quick walk. How does that sound as a potential plan to keep you grounded and on track when procrastination pops up?\nclient: Yeah, that sounds like it could work—tying the walk to a coffee break feels like a natural fit and might actually get me moving. I’m just hoping I don’t talk myself out of it when I’m feeling off, but I guess setting that reminder could nudge me in the right direction, you know?\ntherapist: Therapist: It's fantastic that we've identified a few practical strategies that you feel comfortable integrating into your daily routine, like the coffee break walks and breathing exercises. Remember, consistency is key, and it's okay if you don't stick to them perfectly. The goal is to find what works best for you and gradually build healthier habits. \nFor our next session, let's focus on tracking your progress with these strategies and discussing any challenges you may have faced. We can also explore additional techniques to help you stay grounded and motivated. In the meantime, I encourage you to be gentle with yourself and celebrate even the smallest victories. You're taking important steps towards regaining a sense of control and normalcy, and I'm proud of you for that. \nTake care, and I look forward to our next session.\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate the encouragement and the reminder to take it easy on myself. I’ll try to keep track of how these strategies work out and let you know next time.",
