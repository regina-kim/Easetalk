  "concern": "Cognitive Psychology Ph.D.   \nI'm a 4th year, so you think I'd be used to this! I just have no concept of how much professors have in their discretionary. I'm about to run a study that I've gotten blessing after blessing to run. It's been piloted and I even got a mini $1400 grant for it. Unfortunately, I burned through my money pretty quickly during the pilot/trying different ideas out and I now have to drop another $800+ on my advisor's dime. I'm up against a time pressure and I know I need to just do it, but I can't not think in terms of regular person money and I get so so nervous!! I've resorted to loading smaller amounts of money into Prolific, which generates an annoying number of receipts to be processed.   \nSome of the anxiety is because I transferred into this lab in the last year, so I feel like all of my expenses are unplanned expenses. Something that makes me feel better is that my advisor was accepting students this round and ultimately didn't, so that tells me that she was prepared to support another student even after taking me on. She's the head of the department and quite well known, so if there were ever a lab to try out different ideas in, it would be this one. But I'm not on a grant and I don't know where her discretionary money comes from.   \nAfter the failed pilots (which was expensive), she even told me that I need something to work so I can design some follow up studies (clock is ticking), so we might as well \"throw money\" at the problem. Another explicit blessing.\n\n  \nI'm sure I'm not the only one who stresses over this. My friend comes from a very prominent lab and even he books youth hostel lodging and bad flights for conferences out of guilt. Can we all just pump each other up a little here?",
