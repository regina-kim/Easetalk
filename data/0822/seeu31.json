  "concern": "I'm in a MA program right now and we just started in-person learning. Until this week, I had been at my parents' house doing online school from there. While I'm definitely not the biggest proponent of online school, I was actually really enjoying life at home. I got to focus on doing readings and work without worrying about maintaining my own living space, I didn't have a commute to and from classes, and I really enjoyed hanging out with my family every day. Now I'm in a different city which is still pretty shut down from the pandemic, living alone, I can't see anyone, I haven't been able to focus on my coursework that much, and I just feel really *lonely* especially since the people in my cohort aren't keen on getting together due to the pandemic. Even though I absolutely love my program and what I'm studying, I'm starting to question if it's worth the lifestyle choices that are necessary (e.g., moving away from home, the job search being global rather than local). Now, I'm finding myself wishing the weeks would pass until I can go back during the break. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way and how they cope with it. I'm also wondering if moving away for grad school is that much better if there weren't a pandemic shutting everything down/limiting any social activities; especially since so many people refer to grad school as an isolating experience anyway.",

Remember that building connections takes time and it’s okay if it doesn’t happen overnight. Perhaps you could focus on small, positive interactions and celebrate those moments, even if they feel fleeting at first. You could also explore other avenues of connection outside of class, like joining a club or hobby group that aligns with your interests. This way, you’ll be surrounded by people who share your passions, which can make it easier to form meaningful bonds.\nclient: Thanks for reassuring me that it’s okay if things don’t click right away—I needed to hear that. I like the idea of focusing on small wins and checking out clubs or hobby groups, but I’m kinda worried about overextending myself with everything else on my plate; do you think there’s a way to balance trying new things like that without feeling overwhelmed?\ntherapist: You're absolutely right to be mindful of your energy and time. It might help to start with one small step at a time—like trying out one new activity or reaching out to one classmate this week. That way, you can see how it feels and adjust as you go, without putting too much pressure on yourself. And remember, it's okay to take breaks or say no to things that don't feel right—it's all part of finding that balance that works for you.\nclient: Thanks for understanding my need to pace myself—I really appreciate the idea of starting with just one small step at a time. It feels a lot less daunting to think about reaching out to one person or checking out one activity instead of diving into a bunch of stuff at once. I guess I’m just still a bit unsure about how to prioritize when everything feels important, like schoolwork versus trying to make friends—do you have any thoughts on how to figure out what to focus on first without feeling like I’m neglecting something else?\ntherapist: One way to approach this could be by identifying which activities align most closely with your current needs and values. For instance, if you're feeling particularly isolated, prioritizing one social activity might take precedence over a less pressing academic task. It’s also helpful to consider the long-term benefits of building connections, as these relationships can support you throughout your academic journey. Remember, it’s not about doing everything at once, but rather finding a balance that allows you to nurture both your personal and academic growth.\nclient: Thanks for breaking it down like that—it helps to think about what I need most right now instead of trying to tackle everything at once. I guess I’m feeling like the isolation is hitting me harder than the schoolwork stress at the moment, so maybe focusing on one small social thing could be a good starting point. I’m just wondering, though, how do I keep myself from overthinking if that one outreach doesn’t pan out? Like, I don’t want to get discouraged if it feels like a dead end.\ntherapist: You're doing a great job of being self-aware and mindful of your needs, and that's a powerful first step. Remember that every connection, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, is a step in the right direction. If one outreach doesn't lead to a meaningful connection, it doesn't mean that it was a waste of time or effort. It simply means that you've learned something new about what works for you and what doesn't, and you can use that information to guide your future efforts. It's also important to be gentle with yourself and to acknowledge that building connections is a process that takes time and patience. So, try to focus on the journey, rather than the destination, and celebrate the small wins along the way. And if you ever feel discouraged or overwhelmed, remember that you can always come back to our sessions to talk through your feelings and work through any challenges that come up.\nclient: Thanks for the reminder to see each step as progress, even if it doesn’t work out the way I hope. I’ll try to keep that perspective and not be too hard on myself if things feel slow. I’m glad I can come back here to talk if I hit a rough patch—it really helps knowing I’ve got this space to figure things out. So, I guess for now, I’ll just pick one person or group to reach out to this week and see how it goes.\ntherapist: You've made significant progress in understanding the importance of pacing yourself and prioritizing your needs. By focusing on one small social step at a time, you're setting yourself up for success without feeling overwhelmed. Remember that every connection, no matter how small, is a step in the right direction. If your first outreach doesn't pan out, don't be discouraged—it's all part of the process, and you'll learn valuable lessons along the way. Keep in mind that building connections takes time and patience, and it's essential to be gentle with yourself. Celebrate the small wins and know that you can always come back to our sessions to talk through any challenges that arise.\nclient: Thanks for the encouragement and for reinforcing that it’s okay to take things slow. I feel a bit more confident about trying this out, and I’ll keep in mind that it’s all part of learning, no matter the outcome. So, I guess I’ll see you next time, and I’ll let you know how it goes with reaching out to someone this week.",
