  "concern": "I've been struggling most of my life with pretty bad depression, and things only started to get better after my first year in college. But now I've fallen back into it, very deeply. I don't know how much to share but for an idea of how bad it's gotten, I have been skipping a lot of my classes and not doing any of my assignments, nor caring enough to do anything about it. I have suicidal thoughts, and I'm trying to get onto antidepressants but it's difficult to get diagnosis and seek medical help due to conflict with my parents and school. I've also been trying to get diagnosed with ADHD, which I've been pretty sure I have for a long time now, but that has been difficult too. I have a therapist I see twice a week, which has been helpful sometimes, but I think I need more.\n\nI don't think I can keep going like this. my last semester I got all A's, so to outsiders it seems like I'm doing fine, but man, I'm an art student. Grades barely matter, and those A's are more indicative of how generous and understanding my professors were; in reality I barely attended class, finished less than half of my projects the whole semester, and dropped classes to go part-time, hoping it would help, but it wasn't enough. \n\nMy parents and my therapist have basically told me different versions of \"just power through it\", but I can't. Especially because all of my assignments are art. It's not a set start or finish, a list of questions to answer, or busywork. It's always personal and being creative is really hard for me right now, almost impossible. My parents are also scared that if I take a leave of absence and get a job or something, I'll be stuck doing that forever and never go back to school. The only person that has suggested that a leave might be a good idea was my advisor. \n\nBut I know a lot of people deal with depression in college, and they still carry on. Am I just being lazy, or giving up too easily? Just making an excuse to do nothing? I want to spend the time off seeking more active mental help, but is that enough reason? I don't know anymore.",
