I want to work with kids but IQ testing (WISC, etc) does not interest me much, and I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs what I will be doing most of the time. I'm way more interested in the counseling side of things, which makes me think I should pursue an MSW instead‚Ä¶ any insight on this would help me bunches, I‚Äôm so torn because I love my cohort and professors but I‚Äôm not big on cognitive assessments!
