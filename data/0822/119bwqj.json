  "concern": "I graduated college less than a year ago (May 2022); and my undergraduate experience was already screwed up by COVID-19 - I was forced to skip out on a full year before returning to Senior year because the US did not allow international students to take hybrid classes and my university was not offering at least 3 in-person classes for me during the 2020 - 2021 lockdown. So I got to watch all my friends graduate without me; I did qualify for an accelerated Master's Program in Economics and I was accepted but I opted not to pursue it due to COVID-19 and feeling that I did not want to stay in Fordham for both undergraduate and graduate school.  \n\n\nAnyway, I somehow managed to get a short-term contract at the World Bank since they hired people from around the world, and if I work for the World Bank in a full-time job for about 15 years I am eligible for permanent residency (green card). For all intents and purposes I really want to stay and live and build a life in the US (especially now with geopolitical events in SE Asia). The problem is that I don't have options for employment in the private sector because the H1-b process is absurdly random and difficult; and the World Bank and IMF have outright told me that I can't get a fulltime job without AT LEAST a Master's Degree (it's already brutally difficult for me to get even a short-term contract role, let alone a fulltime job); and even this employment is not guaranteed.  \n\n\nI'm thinking of getting a Master's Degree in Statistics or Data Science (an MBA or Master's degree in economics isn't very helpful) but I have checked that I did not take enough undergrad courses in Math or Computer Science to qualify (at least in the US). I'm fairly certain that my math skills and coding skills are nowhere near good enough for grad school (I struggled for a 3.60 gpa even before COVID-19)  \nI'm honestly totally lost because I'm being forced to prepare for grad school so soon, just after I managed to find something solid career-wise (I'm 23 turning 24). Otherwise I have to go back to the Philippines and I probably won't have an opportunity to immigrate elsewhere anymore.  \n\n\nAny advice for my circumstances?",

Can we maybe tweak it a bit to also mention my background briefly, just so they get why I’ve got these gaps, or should I keep it super short for now?\ntherapist: Including a brief mention of your background could help provide context for your advisor, but let's keep it concise to avoid overwhelming them. How about adding a sentence like, “My undergraduate studies focused on [your major], which didn't heavily emphasize math and coding, so I'm eager to bridge that gap.” This way, you're offering insight into your background without losing focus on your main goal. What do you think?\nclient: Yeah, I like that addition—it feels right to give a little context without going into a whole life story. Do you think we could work on the full draft now, or should we brainstorm a bit more on how to word the part about asking for specific resources or courses to help me catch up?\ntherapist: Let's work on the full draft together, incorporating the background sentence we discussed. Here's a suggested draft for the email:\nSubject: Seeking Guidance on Grad School Preparation and Skill Development\nDear [Advisor's Name],\nI hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss my preparation for grad school, specifically my math and coding skills. My undergraduate studies focused on [your major], which didn't heavily emphasize math and coding, so I'm eager to bridge that gap and strengthen these areas.\nI would greatly appreciate any guidance or recommendations you might have on resources, courses, or strategies to help me improve my math and coding abilities. I am committed to putting in the necessary effort to ensure I am well-prepared for graduate studies.\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing this further with you and exploring ways to address my skill gaps.\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nThis draft maintains a focus on your primary concerns while providing some context for your advisor. Feel free to modify it as needed to best represent your situation.\nclient: Hey, this draft looks really good—thanks for putting it together. I think it hits the right tone, and I might just tweak a couple of words to make it sound a bit more like me, but overall, I’m feeling pretty confident about sending this out.",
