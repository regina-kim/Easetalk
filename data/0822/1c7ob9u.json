  "concern": "I’m a second year undergrad thinking of pursuing PhD in population biology/ecology. As I’m entering the summer, I plan to continue a research project I’ve worked on throughout the summer, although since meetings with my PI will become remote, I expect that to slow down.\n\nTherefore, I’m looking for something meaningful to fill the rest of my days! (I haven’t applied to anything ahead of time) It could be something that pads my grad school application, or just something that gives me the chance to learn and grow.\n\nSo, what are things you would have done in your freshman/sophomore summer? 3 months is a whole lot of time, and while many people say it’s fine to just enjoy it (junior year is when you should really get something serious under your belt), I don’t want to spend this summer with heaps of free time like freshman summer. I’m open to doing some self learning/personal projects but from past experience this has been really hard to keep going.",
