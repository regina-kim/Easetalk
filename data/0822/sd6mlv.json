  "concern": "It has been about 4.5 years since I graduated my PhD program and it still feels like it happened last year. I know that everyone has a different grad school experience but I definitely had some of the lowest moments \nof my life (along with a few of the best ones too). I wanted to post this because I wasn't sure if it might be relatable to some of you who are currently in a PhD/masters program or recently graduated. Its not easy to share something intimate like this but if it helps someone then it is worth it. \n\nThis year, my wife and I did some soul searching and met with a mental health professional to work on understanding ourselves more and improving the quality of our relationship together. Through this experience I was able to understand how my experience in grad school shaped how I acted in my day to day life. I think the constant pressure of presenting positive results, delivering flawless presentations/talks, mastering techniques, etc. in grad school can drive us to an unhealthy self-image of always needing to be always perfect. At least it did for me. Understanding, being comfortable with and even being happy with my imperfections has really helped me overcome this perfection complex.\n\nThe point of this post is just to say that there will always be failures, always be imperfections, and always be mistakes and that is ok. Grad school isn't easy and mistakes don't make you any less valuable as a person or a researcher. You are all valuable and amazing just the way you are no matter how many times things get messed up. Even if you don't believe that yet, I can say that I do and that is at least one person that believes in you. I know this might not resonate with everyone but I hope it did with someone.",
