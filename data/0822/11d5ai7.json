  "concern": "I just finished an online calc exam and got a question wrong solely because I forgot to add a negative sign to the answer. I had about 5 minutes left on the exam when I came to that question, so I was so extremely panicked and rushed to the point of where I didn’t even notice it. \n\nI’m not even 100% sure it was the right answer, but the fact that I forgot the negative sign and potentially ruining my chance of getting it right is eating me up. \n\nIs it appropriate to contact my professor over this issue? I’m not asking for her to change my grade, but honestly I’ll even take partial credit. I have my work written down, so I can definitely show her that I knew there was a negative sign. I believe I’m supposed to message the TA about any questions, but I’m not sure they have much authority over that.",
