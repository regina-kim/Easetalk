Sundays i work 5pm-10pm. \n\nI am curious about if this schedule is ok or if I should consider working only saturday and sunday, both from around 11 am/12 pm until 10 pm/11 pm. \n\nMy current issue is time management. Some of these classes are killing me. Any input is appreciated.\n\nForgot to mention i am studying CS and am full time student (only 13 credit hours tho)",
