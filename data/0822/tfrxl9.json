  "concern": "I started a masters in 2019 in plasma physics in the UK on a part-time basis, before the pandemic, and its been horribly difficult. despite the subject matter being awesome and the industry interesting i doubt myself. my first degree was in mech. engineering and i dont think this masters for me. i want to be an engineer.\n\nI took a sabbatical from this part time degree after the first year (in 2020/1), due to the pandemic and everything going online - i couldnt cope with working towards a part-time degree online and chose to defer the second year. Now I've resumed the second year and its past christmas and I am horribly un-motivated. i stopped going in, and have only been job searching the past few weeks.\n\nim due for a supervisory meeting with a wonderful lecturer but i think i should confess i need to quit. I have enough credits earned for a PgCert (60+) award. It pains me inside.\n\nplease, any advice on how to proceed professionaly with a PgCert in STEM as an early career starter (engineering grad. ) - i am applying on the basis of my first degree and lack imagination wrt how to use what I got so far in this master. I could ask for an extension and maybe get more done, but a thesis project scares me and i dont know or think itll be good if i dont let go. How can i cope?",
