  "input": "I've been struggling with feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy for as long as I can remember. My parents were always critical of me, and I've carried that self-doubt with me into my adult life. I've tried therapy before, but I never felt like I was making any real progress. I've been feeling particularly low lately, and I've started to engage in self-destructive behaviors, like excessive shopping and binge eating. I'm afraid that if I don't do something about it, I'll spiral out of control.",
