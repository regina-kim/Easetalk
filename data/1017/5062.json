  "input": "I've been feeling increasingly anxious and isolated since my husband's diagnosis with [Health Condition]. I've been trying to be there for him, but it's taking a toll on me. I've been neglecting my own needs and have lost touch with friends and family. I've heard about these virtual caregiver groups, but I'm not sure if I can handle the emotional burden of connecting with others in the same situation.",
  "reason": "The client's concern involves feeling anxious and isolated due to the demands of caregiving, which might imply ambivalence about engaging with supportive resources like caregiver groups.
