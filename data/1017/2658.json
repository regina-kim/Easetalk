  "input": "I've been trying to keep my family happy, especially my daughter who is Bipolar. Seeing her settled and content brings me some degree of emotional fulfillment. However, I can't help but feel empty inside when I'm not contributing to society in a meaningful way. I've spent the last few years focusing on my family, and while I love them dearly, I feel like I've lost touch with my own identity and purpose. I've tried volunteering, but it doesn't seem to fill the void I feel. I've always had a passion for art, but I've never pursued it professionally. I'm afraid of the unknown and the potential failure that comes with it.",
