  "input": "(deep sigh) I've been feeling overwhelmed at work lately, juggling multiple projects and meeting tight deadlines. I've been putting in long hours, barely taking breaks, and I've started to feel drained and burnt out. But when I think about taking a day off or even just a short break, I can't shake the feeling that I don't deserve it. I've always prided myself on my work ethic and my ability to handle a heavy workload, and I fear that taking a break would make me appear weak or uncommitted.",
  "reason": "The client is experiencing work-related stress and burnout, and they express ambivalence about taking breaks due to fears about their work ethic and commitment.
