  "input": "I've been feeling overwhelmed with my caregiving responsibilities for my aging mother. The constant demands of her needs and my own work and family commitments have left me feeling drained and unable to focus on my own well-being. I've noticed that I've been turning to food for comfort, particularly sugary and processed snacks, which only makes me feel worse in the long run. I've tried to establish a routine, but the stress of my situation makes it difficult to stick to it.",
  "reason": "The client is expressing ambivalence about their current behaviors (turning to food for comfort) and is struggling to establish a routine to improve their well-being. Motivational Interviewing can be beneficial in exploring this ambivalence and strengthening their motivation to adopt healthier coping strategies.",
