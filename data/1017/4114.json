Some days I feel good, other days I get bummed out. Yesterday, I was particularly depressed. But today, I've adopted a new attitude. I've been considering quitting my job as an accountant, something I've never found fulfilling. I went into it because of the job market in the late '80s, but I've always felt unfulfilled. I took a sabbatical and taught, which I enjoyed, but when my partner left me for another man, I was forced to return to accounting. I have a good job now, but I'm not happy. Seeing my mother pass away has made me reconsider my life and my choices.",
