  "input": "I've been feeling overwhelmed lately, with my work schedule constantly changing, and my personal life in disarray. I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for years, but it's been particularly challenging lately. My parents divorced when I was young, and I've always felt like I've had to navigate life on my own. I've tried therapy before, but I never seemed to stick with it. I've been struggling with feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, and I can't seem to find the motivation to make any real changes in my life. I've tried self-help books and meditation, but nothing seems to help me feel better for long.",
  "reason": "The client's concern involves feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and a history of anxiety and depression, with an emphasis on lacking motivation to make changes. This suggests ambivalence towards change, which is suitable for MI. MI could help explore and enhance the client's motivation for engaging in therapy or adopting healthier coping strategies.",
