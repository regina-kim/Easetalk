  "input": "I've been grappling with feelings of guilt and the inability to let go of certain responsibilities, especially towards my sister. The guilt stems from an incident years ago when she made a mistake that led to significant consequences for both of us. I've tried to be more forgiving with myself, but I'm finding it difficult to trust my sister to handle things on her own. I'm constantly checking in on her and offering advice, even when it's not asked for. I know I need to let go, but the thought of her making another mistake and the potential consequences terrify me.",
