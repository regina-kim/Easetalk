I have a meeting with my thesis supervisor that I haven't spoken to for 9 months. I have to finish my thesis this school year because otherwise my courses that I passed will expire. My thesis has become such a mountain and it's been getting harder and harder to even find the motivation to climb the first two feet. \n\nQuick background: Started college in september 2012, finished my bachelors in july 2018 because of several back surgeries and depression. Then started my masters in september 2018 and passed all my courses in july 2019. Then I had to start writing my thesis and then had a nervous breakdown. Like full on depressed wanted to die that kind of thing. Covid started, which I (luckily) wasn't that affected by.  I got diagnosed with autism (which explained a. lot.) Got depressed again, started having back issues again. My parents finally convinced me to move back with them. \n\nIt's been good. I have a job. My colleagues are really nice. My thesis supervisor is really nice. I have been very fortunate to have been born in a country in which college is relatively cheap and where mental care (and other healthcare is available and also relatively cheap). I have a loving family.\n\nBut that fucking thesis does my head in. I have anxiety attacks when I think about it. I stress about everyday but don't end up doing any work. I'm soooo close but I feel like a failure everytime I get feedback. And I lost all inspiration (if I had some in the first place.) \n\nI'm trying to pick myself up and get myself to work. But every tip and trick that is out there to get yourself started I just completely forget once the anxiety about the thesis lets itself know in my body. I just feel so horrible and want to do anything else not to feel all those knots in my stomach. I make up scenarios in my head where my thesis supervisor secretly hates me and thinks I'm a failure even though he's very kind. I think all my teachers think that I'm weak and weird and just find me a burden. I hate typing a paragraph and knowing it's going to be shit anyway. Graduatin college still feels so far out of my reach even though I have 14,000 word written that I hope aren't half bad.\n\nI'm just at a loss and wanted to get this of my chest. I'm meeting with him in half an hour and my heart is beating like crazy.","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

The PhD research requires sample collection and environmental surveying, which must take place from the spring to the fall.\n\nBecause the program pays poorly and has extremely limited teaching assistant options, I am attempting to join my local regiment as an Army Reservist because it pays and could potentially get me a foot in the door for a government pension down the line. However, the recruiting website states that at least 2 summers of 2 months of full-time work are required in order to achieve status as a reservist. This seems very likely to conflict with my most important research work, and my supervisor may not permit it because the university has strict rules about how many hours\/week a student may work outside their program.\n\nHas anyone had any experience balancing the demands of working in the reserves with a graduate school program before? Is it reasonable to continue with my application to the Forces, or should I not bother?","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

My top programs are asking for tuition on par with entry-level salary in my field. I'm wondering if I should've attended a cheaper undergrad uni, but the opportunities I had access to here is part the reason I was admitted this round.\n\nLet's say I can handle (take out loans) the MS tuition for 2 years. Then is a PhD next? A solid 3-7 years of (maybe) being funded with a living stipend (perhaps) that would leave me barely breaking even with living expenses and definitely incapable of paying back student loans. I guess the best path would've been going straight from BS to PhD, but COVID-19 in the middle of my undergraduate years cancelled a couple of research opportunities that I would've taken advantage of otherwise; thus, I wouldn't be as strong of a candidate for PhD programs. \n\nI will be the first in my family to attend graduate school, if we can find a way to afford it.

Let\u2019s call her Jenny for the sake of this post. \nJenny has been making my life a living hell. \nEvery movement I make, every letter i type on the keyboard what I eat, where I eat, it all causes Jenny to make a mockery out of me.\n\nNow, Jenny has been snitching on us so the dr responsible for our lab appointed her as our boss. She makes us go carry heavy stuff\/ manual labor or go buy stuff she needs for her experiments and if we say NO she used the \u201cI\u2019m a boss here, if you don\u2019t follow me i\u2019ll tell the drs and you can be kicked out of the program\u201d card. \nI have been her target for 2 years now and she is a semester behind in the program.\nToday we had a small celebration for one of our colleagues for successfully beating cancer. Let\u2019s call that colleague Lily.\nNow Jenny got a cake without telling anyone that it was today, and when we wanted to pay our parts back she (Jenny) said : \u201c I only take payments in USD , Go to the exchanger and unless you bring me USD i am not accepting your payment. \u201c mind you that both pounds and USD are used here and our country\u2019s pounds is more readily available for small payments. For example it is extremely difficult to find a 5$ bill but very easy to find it in pounds.\nIt is the way she gives orders and when i confront her she twists the scenario making it seem i am the one causing trouble and i am sick of it. \nIn front of us \u201c i am the best here you need to follow me\u201d but if the drs give her a compliment she directly switches to \u201c on no , i\u2019m feeling very humble! You\u2019re giving me too much credit, I think the harmony in our lab is a team effort~\u201d\nThe minute the drs walk out she\u2019s like\u201d are they stupid!\u201d\nEven a few days ago, Lily received a call from someone who was getting treatment with her but wasn\u2019t unfortunate enough to recover and that she wanted to talk to LiLy and bid her farewells and Jenny told Lily to block her \u2026.\nAnother instance was she told me i wasn\u2019t raised right because i said goodbye to my advisor not the other way around. \nShe also keeps criticizing that she is fed up with the speed of my typing, and no my paper has a deadline i am not stopping for her.\n3 years ago during masters Jenny was my roommate and her space was a mess .\nShe made up a no eating rule in the room yet she eats there herself and when i confronted her she said \u201c your food smells of spices mine doesn\u2019t so i am allowed to eat here but you\u2019re not\u201d\nShe also told Lily that i was messy which LiLy replied to \u201c how could you live together with someone this messy, you poor thing must\u2019ve been so stressed\u201d\nWhile i swear to anything you believe in , that i used to tidy her spot if i just wanted to walk decently in the room.\nShe also made a \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to turn the AC rule\u201d but when she was hot she turned it and said but i am hot, and when i told her when I was feeling hot you didn\u2019t let me turn it on and she replied \u201cbut i wasn\u2019t hot\u201d\nThe other day she asked me why do you out spaces after semi columns. And at a conference abroad last year she said she didn\u2019t need a sim . Bought one and put it in my phone, and out of nowhere she says \u201cgive me the sim i need to talk to my boyfriend\u201d\nI said no. She stood on the sidewalk and yelled you piece of shit you\u2019re not giving me the sim!!! You\u2019ll see , i\u2019ll harm you, you\u2019ll see! Like she waited for the sim to be handed to her.\nAnd the last day we were supposed to split an uber to the airport and then last minute she said there is no place for me . When i told her that is not what she said she lied to my face and said she has no idea what I am talking about and she convinced other that i must be dumb.Luckily there was another student who witnessed the entire thing and told her , i have heard it too.also she fatshames people after she lost weight.\n\nIt is like every movement of mine is either rejected ,refuted or twisted to appear as if i am in the wrong. She is multiple faced and tbh doesn\u2019t deserve the power she is been given .","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

Moved here last fall, and I graduate this spring. I have the option of applying for a PhD after I graduate while I\u2019m on OPT here which was originally the plan. But I\u2019ve thought about it a lot, and I think it might be better for me to move back to my home country and work in my area of interest for a bit before applying for a PhD. I already did one cycle of PhD applications before this Masters and didn\u2019t get in anywhere for the PhD, and got the Masters instead. \n\nSince the PhD was the original plan, I really moved here thinking I won\u2019t move back for a while. But now that I\u2019m thinking about moving back, I\u2019m a bit bothered by it. I love it here, I\u2019ve made amazing friends that I go out with regularly, but I also don\u2019t want to apply for a PhD when I\u2019m not sure about it. I love my home country, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll hate moving back. But it\u2019s like being stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nIs moving back home and trying again after a while okay? I keep spiralling and thinking it\u2019s some type of failure on my part for not having figured it out. Am I screwing up my chances by moving back? Or will I screw them up worse by applying when I\u2019m not sure? \n\nFunnily enough, I\u2019ve been so focused on studying that I haven\u2019t even enjoyed my move here, nor have I explored anything in the city or the country much. So all of it just seems like a bunch of missed opportunities, and i feel like I\u2019ll be going back with almost no new experiences. \n\nI don\u2019t know what answer I expect. But I\u2019m mentally messed up at this point and I feel like I don\u2019t have any options in front of me, and nothing seems worth it anymore. \n\n\nPS. Scheduled a meeting with a therapist asap.

If I don't get a publication out of this, I'm not interested in the project at all.\" I asked, \"Do you mean you wouldn't sign off on my thesis?\" and he said yes. Has anybody else dealt with something like this? Like, is this legal???\n\nEdit: For more clarification, I\u2019m a master\u2019s student who was supposed to defend in December 2022. I\u2019m enrolling in a PhD program in the fall, so the legality thing is an exaggeration, but the PI being as asshole about this isn\u2019t.","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

The lab I work in doesn't have any strict hours, and half the people don't even show up on the weekend (and those that do, don't do it every single weekend). Having seen the labs at my undergrad (and the 70+ hrs\/week students put in there), I know this idea of a *genuine* work life balance is often times thought of as a myth, however, now that I've been exposed to how wonderful things *could* be, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the fact that most labs in most schools simply don't operate that way.\n\nI want to get my PhD in organic, and currently I have an offer from a good school that I'm considering (Boston College), however, it seems that most labs\/PIs there (and elsewhere) are fairly strict about the minimum 6 days a week BS, and some even enforce minimum hours\/day. \n\nI personally think that if you're good about time management and planning things out then coming in on the weekend should be more of a rarity, but most profs don't feel that way.\n\nI guess I'm wondering if anyone else has been able to achieve a genuine\/healthy work life balance doing their PhD in chemistry, and if so, how did you approach this with your advisor? Were they aware that you weren't in 24\/7? Did you say something to them to establish this boundary? I'm not sure what I should be looking for\/if it's a possibility that I could find something similar to the lab I'm currently at.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot stay in this lab\/school, so I have to consider other options.\n\nThanks in advance!","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

Especially when COVID hit, that added a lot more pressure in general. I don't say this lightly but it absolutely devastated me. I had terrible depression, OCD and awful anxiety, but nonetheless I started my program hoping to push that aside. Another thing to note, is that I came from a very religious background and through connecting the dots realized that it was actually a cult that my dad started and funded mid way through the semester. I realized how much control and manipulation both my parents had put me through my whole life. It was overwhelming to say the least. My brain sort of broke around mid terms and I was crying through every single test. I, of course failed those exams, because I was so devastated and hurt, shocked and in deep grief. I was taking shots of tequila in the AM to calm myself down before my classes and mid terms to try to work through the pain, but it was to no avail. To avoid failing my classes, I took a leave of absence and didn't take my finals. At the same time, I was let go of my part time job which was helping support me with living expenses during my time in school. Lastly, my marriage was really strained and felt like it was also falling apart. The amount of stress and grief was overwhelming, and I was in a such a low place that I checked myself into an IOP (intensive out patient) therapy center. So for the first part of 2022, I went to over 400 hours of therapy to heal myself and deal with the intense trauma of it all. I lived off of credit cards and money I had saved for myself to pay for my program. As the year progressed, I was able to come above water for the first time and start getting back into my program. I had to take every final and write all of my research papers almost a year later, while also completing the current fall semester. It was so difficult to recall the information, but I was able to scrape by and finish with not stellar grades but still passed. I also enrolled back into the fall semester of 2022 and am finishing up my program (hopefully) this spring. Unfortunately my grades were sub par my first semester that I may be below the graduation requirement (3.0) , but I am hoping that my program will allow me to still walk and just pass me so I can move on from this life. I had to take out loans to live while I am in school because it is so involved, I cut ties with my parents (I was really close with my mom so that hurt), and am grinding out this semester to finally fucking finish! This isn't a post about pushing through adversity or anything, it is just venting that, this whole experience has been so hard and I am ready to be done. Lastly, being in your 30's in school is EXTREMELY harder than when I was in my young 20's.","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

But the loneliness is really getting to me. My parents don't support me or ask how I am doing. My mom is angry that I am not cleaning or cooking as much as I used to. I am helping my brother in a program he is in, and he is not taking responsibility and not listening to me (my parents are not stepping in). \n\nAnd on top of that, I don't hear from my big group of friends (which I am realizing are now acquaintances). They don't check in on me, one does once in a while and we may hang out but I have to organize it. I am so exhausted from having to go through life alone. It feels like no one cares about me, and that I get no support. Just last week my family was in crisis, and I didn't know who to turn to. My bestie often responds hours after and another person who I thought was a good friend often invalidates me and tells me to focus on whats perfect. I thought huh, maybe I should reach out to a crisis line.\n\nPeople keep telling me I need to be patient, and I should be happy. But Im just exhausted and easily upset. So, is anyone else lonely?

That last one is, admittedly, entirely my fault. I very much want to work on something that is within the scope of the lab, but that my PI has not worked on before personally.\n\nHere's the issue: she wants me to do my qualifying exam in January, but I still feel like I know nothing about the state of our field. It's small, and I think I know what's been looked at by the biggest group in the area, but I don't know if what I'm doing is too close to their work. I feel very overwhelmed when trying to write up my specific aims, because I don't know how big or small my scope should be considering that I have no data and will have to do 100% of the work myself. I've been trying to look for some resources on how to determine scope and things like that, but I've been reading for a good chunk of break and I actually feel more uncertain than when I started.\n\nIf anyone has thoughts on starting from the ground up like this, I would very much appreciate it.

I've always been fascinated by the history of religion's influence on global affairs, social development, government regulation, etc. I spend most of my free time reading on these topics. However, I'm aware of the challenges in these fields: they're highly competitive, underfunded, and aren't expected to grow. (Rip humanities)\n\nBeyond academia, I'm open to exploring other fulfilling paths such as public policy, government, or the medical field. However, I'm uncertain where to begin in discovering options in these fields that I could pursue.\nI'm willing to pursue further education through a master's or doctorate to make this career switch, but I want to be sure it's not a dead end. Currently, I'm still paying off my undergraduate loans ($25,000 remaining).\n\nI suppose I'm really looking for advice from those who have been in a similar situation. With my current background, where can I go from here without net to start from scratch? I really need to get out of Silicur Valley world and the people in it. Apologies for the long post, and thanks in advance to all.\n","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}
