  "concern": "Hello! \nMy partner is currently a theatre student in his second year. He was going for a bachelors but it seems to be too much for him. He had the plan to just drop out entirely. But I made the suggestion to get an associates because I’ve always been told a degree and some college experience is better than just a high school diploma. Was I wrong in making suggestion or is it a good idea? Does anyone here have an AA in general studies? If so what kind of jobs open up with that kind of opportunities open up with having that?\nThank you to anyone who responds :)",
