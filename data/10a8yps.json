  "concern": "I am about to graduate from community college with an Associates in physics and am wanting to move onto getting my bachelors as well. I want to be an astrophysicist. I know I'll need to get my doctorate in astronomy/astrophysics in order to achieve this. The problem is that I don't know how I can do this because I need to work and pay bills and can't just do school alone. I was never taught much about school after high school so I am not sure how I would do this.  I was given the idea of getting a dual undergrad degree in engineering and physics. The possibility being I could use those 2 degrees to get a career that pays me well so that I could sustain my efforts of going for a doctorate. My question is, is it possible to get a dual degree in these 2 fields? I am sure the workload and effort it would take would be really high, so should I even consider it? Would it be more feasible for me to just get one bachelors and then be done? How do people who go to get their doctorates do it? Do they work and do school on the side or, do they do school alone? I'm 23 now and after some drastic life circumstances that occurred right before I graduated high school I feel I was cast into the ocean of life with no direction or resources to figure out what I wanted to do or how I could do it. Is it too late for me to strive after becoming an Astronomer?",
