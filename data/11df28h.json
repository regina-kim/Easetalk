  "concern": "The title is pretty self explanatory. I'll receive training to become a crisis counseling volunteer. I'm super excited to be given this opportunity as l'm a BS Psych major who would love to pursue psychiatry one day. I'II complete a 30 hour training program that covers active listening and other specific skills, like ways to approach issues like self-harm, suicide, depression, bullying and how to appropriately help LGBTQ+ respondents. \n\nAt the end of my volunteer commitment, I will have at least 200 hours in my first year. I can continue this commitment after as well.\nBut, is this good volunteer experience? What type of extracurricular would this be considered? Pretty sure it's not clinical. I just hope it \"looks\" good, I'm really excited either way and know it'll be a great learning opportunity!\n\nI do plan on applying to Medical School, so I’m really wondering if this volunteer work fits nicely. I’m a first gen student with not much guidance so any advice is appreciated!",
