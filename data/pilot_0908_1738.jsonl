Until this week, I had been at my parents' house doing online school from there. While I'm definitely not the biggest proponent of online school, I was actually really enjoying life at home. I got to focus on doing readings and work without worrying about maintaining my own living space, I didn't have a commute to and from classes, and I really enjoyed hanging out with my family every day. Now I'm in a different city which is still pretty shut down from the pandemic, living alone, I can't see anyone, I haven't been able to focus on my coursework that much, and I just feel really *lonely* especially since the people in my cohort aren't keen on getting together due to the pandemic. Even though I absolutely love my program and what I'm studying, I'm starting to question if it's worth the lifestyle choices that are necessary (e.g., moving away from home, the job search being global rather than local). Now, I'm finding myself wishing the weeks would pass until I can go back during the break. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way and how they cope with it. I'm also wondering if moving away for grad school is that much better if there weren't a pandemic shutting everything down\/limiting any social activities; especially since so many people refer to grad school as an isolating experience anyway.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello!

Can you share more about what specifically triggers these changes in how you feel?\nclient: client: I think it's mainly the feedback from my advisors and peers. Sometimes they praise my work, and that boosts my confidence, but other times they point out areas of improvement, and I start second-guessing myself. It's like I can't find a steady ground.\ntherapist: Therapist: It sounds like you're navigating a lot of mixed feedback, which makes it hard to feel steady. When you think about your goals and what's important to you, how does this feedback impact your motivation or vision for your thesis?\nclient: client: Honestly, the feedback sometimes throws me off track and makes me question my direction, but it also pushes me to refine my ideas and improve. I try to remind myself of my long-term goals, which helps keep me motivated even when the feedback is tough to hear.\ntherapist: Therapist: It's great that you hold on to your long-term goals to stay motivated. How do you envision your thesis contributing to those broader life goals you value?\nclient: I see my thesis as a stepping stone towards a career in my field, where I can make a meaningful impact. It's more than just a requirement; it's a way to develop skills and knowledge that align with my future aspirations.\ntherapist: Therapist: It's inspiring to see how you view your thesis as a crucial part of your future aspirations. Based on what you’ve shared, a potential goal could be to maintain your motivation and refine your work despite the mixed feedback. Would you like to explore specific strategies to keep your focus and confidence steady along the way?\nclient: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I definitely need some strategies to help me stay grounded and not get too caught up in the ups and downs of feedback. Do you have any suggestions?\ntherapist: Therapist: Absolutely, let's focus on strategies that could help you stay grounded. It's wonderful that you're open to exploring this. One approach could be establishing a routine that includes regular breaks and self-care activities, which might help balance the stress. Another strategy could involve setting specific times to review feedback so it doesn't overwhelm your entire day. Also, keeping a journal to track your progress and reflect on the positive aspects of your thesis journey could build confidence. It's truly commendable how you're dedicated to refining your work. As a next step, consider identifying one or two of these strategies to try out this week. Remember, progress takes time, and you're doing a great job by staying committed to your goals.\nclient: Thanks for the suggestions. I think I might try setting specific times for feedback and maybe start a journal. It could help give me some structure and perspective.","completed":false}

{"id":"119bwqj","timestamp":1677024000000,"category":"school_life","concern":"I graduated college less than a year ago (May 2022); and my undergraduate experience was already screwed up by COVID-19 - I was forced to skip out on a full year before returning to Senior year because the US did not allow international students to take hybrid classes and my university was not offering at least 3 in-person classes for me during the 2020 - 2021 lockdown. So I got to watch all my friends graduate without me; I did qualify for an accelerated Master's Program in Economics and I was accepted but I opted not to pursue it due to COVID-19 and feeling that I did not want to stay in Fordham for both undergraduate and graduate school.  \n\n\nAnyway, I somehow managed to get a short-term contract at the World Bank since they hired people from around the world, and if I work for the World Bank in a full-time job for about 15 years I am eligible for permanent residency (green card). For all intents and purposes I really want to stay and live and build a life in the US (especially now with geopolitical events in SE Asia). The problem is that I don't have options for employment in the private sector because the H1-b process is absurdly random and difficult; and the World Bank and IMF have outright told me that I can't get a fulltime job without AT LEAST a Master's Degree (it's already brutally difficult for me to get even a short-term contract role, let alone a fulltime job); and even this employment is not guaranteed.  \n\n\nI'm thinking of getting a Master's Degree in Statistics or Data Science (an MBA or Master's degree in economics isn't very helpful) but I have checked that I did not take enough undergrad courses in Math or Computer Science to qualify (at least in the US). I'm fairly certain that my math skills and coding skills are nowhere near good enough for grad school (I struggled for a 3.60 gpa even before COVID-19)  \nI'm honestly totally lost because I'm being forced to prepare for grad school so soon, just after I managed to find something solid career-wise (I'm 23 turning 24).

How do you envision your life and career might change, both positively and negatively, with and without making this change?\nclient: I guess if I change it, I'd feel more like myself and that could be empowering, you know? But then, there's that fear of having to re-establish myself professionally and the hassle of explaining it to everyone.

On a scale from 0 to 10, how confident do you feel about navigating these challenges if you decide to go through with the change?\nclient: Hmm, I'd say maybe a 5 or 6. I feel like I could handle some of the challenges, but the uncertainty of how it might play out professionally makes me hesitate. It's a bit daunting to think about navigating all that.\ntherapist: therapist: It's understandable to feel that uncertainty, and acknowledging those feelings is a big step. What aspects of this change might make you feel more confident or bring that confidence number higher?\nclient: client: I think having a clear plan on how to communicate the change to my professional network would help.

{"id":"1fwghnn","timestamp":1728086400000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"As the title says my roommate doesn’t clean up after themself. Now our room isn’t a complete disaster and it’s mainly their side (plus our bathroom but it’s kinda 70\/30 on who makes the most mess of it) but they just don’t really clean up. They have cups and cans and bottles all over their nightstand and desk and have even had a cup under their bed on the dresser before, and they’re never empty either. They also go home every weekend so they don’t really have dishes or real food here so they’re all Starbucks and Dunkin’ cups, so half full coffees just sitting there separating for weeks as they go home and come back. They do sorta clean it after a few weeks, I’ve seen them bag up the cups and other garbage, but they don’t take it out. They have bags full of garbage in the corner on their side of the room and our rooms not big so it’s starting to creep towards our closet almost in the way of it. As for the bathroom they leave hair everywhere and I know it’s theirs and not mine because it’s their little rubber bands with the hair. Now like I said I am also at fault for the the bathroom being messy but I try to keep it somewhat clean by taking out the garbage and have cleaned the shower drain but they don’t even try to clean up a bit. I don’t know how they don’t get embarrassed when they have a friend over or even just with me being here. I get embarrassed having 2 cans on my desk and a few dirty forks or spoons for a few days because I’m too tired to wash them yet. Otherwise they’re a good roommate it’s just they never clean. I should also say they had a single room last year so it definitely feels like part of the reason since they would be used to not sharing a space but I want to have friends over and I’m embarrassed for my roommate.

It'd be nice to invite friends over without worrying about the mess or feeling like I have to apologize for it.\ntherapist: It seems like having an inviting space is really meaningful to you. On a scale from 0 to 10, how confident do you feel about finding a way to address this with your roommate?\nclient: client: Honestly, probably like a 4. I just don't want things to get awkward between us, but I know I need to say something.\ntherapist: Therapist: It takes courage to think about having that conversation. What might help bump that confidence up from a 4?\nclient: client: Maybe if I had a plan or some specific things to say that wouldn't come off as confrontational. I think knowing how to approach the conversation would make me feel a bit more prepared.\ntherapist: Therapist: Knowing how to approach it thoughtfully could indeed make a difference. What might it feel like if you were able to express your needs in a way that aligns with your values around maintaining a good relationship with your roommate?\nclient: client: I think I'd feel a lot more relieved and hopefully closer to them, like we can understand each other better. It would be great to just have that open conversation and keep the peace.\ntherapist: Therapist: Feeling relieved and maintaining that closeness sounds really valuable to you. How does this vision of mutual understanding fit with your overall goals for living together?\nclient: I really want us to have a comfortable and enjoyable living space, where we both feel respected and can have friends over without stress. It aligns with my goal of making our room a place where we both feel at ease and happy.\ntherapist: Therapist: It sounds like creating a peaceful and respectful home environment is very important to you. How do you see this goal influencing your next steps with your roommate?\nclient: client: I guess it means I need to start a conversation sooner rather than later. Maybe I could think of a kind way to bring it up, like suggesting a cleaning schedule or something that feels fair for both of us.\ntherapist: Therapist: Considering the importance of a respectful environment, initiating a conversation about a cleaning schedule could be a great step. Based on what you've mentioned, possible options might include setting a specific day to discuss and agree on a schedule, or writing down some ideas beforehand for clarity. What do you think could work best for you in starting this conversation?\nclient: I think writing down some ideas beforehand might help me feel more prepared and confident. Maybe I'll try setting a specific day to talk when it feels right for both of us, so it's not forced or awkward.\ntherapist: Writing down your ideas sounds like a thoughtful way to prepare and setting a mutual time for the talk adds respect and ease. How about creating a simple action plan, like listing out a few topics you’d like to address, and deciding on a timeframe to initiate the conversation? What potential challenges or obstacles do you foresee, and how might you overcome them?\nclient: I could see it being challenging if my roommate gets defensive or doesn't see the issue the same way I do. To overcome that, I think I'll focus on expressing how I feel and maybe emphasize the benefits for both of us, rather than pointing fingers or sounding accusatory.\ntherapist: You've put a lot of thought into this, and your approach really shines through. By focusing on expressing your feelings and highlighting the mutual benefits, you're setting a positive tone for the conversation. It sounds like preparing your thoughts and finding a good time to talk is a solid plan. Remember, it's okay to pause and regroup if the conversation doesn't go as you hoped. You're doing great by thinking ahead. Perhaps setting a date to revisit this topic can help keep the momentum. You're not alone in this, and if you ever need more support, we can explore new strategies together.\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate that. I’ll keep all that in mind and aim to handle it as calmly as possible.\ntherapist: It sounds like you have a solid plan, and I'm really impressed with your proactive approach. By preparing your thoughts and focusing on a respectful and positive discussion, you're taking important steps toward creating a more comfortable living space for both of you. Remember, it's entirely okay to take a step back and regroup if needed. You're doing a great job handling this, and I'm here to support you whenever you need it. Let's aim to touch base soon to see how things progress and explore any new strategies together. You've got this!\nclient: Thanks, I’ll keep working on it. Let's definitely catch up soon to see how things go.","completed":false}
{"id":"11ro6p7","timestamp":1678838400000,"category":"academic","concern":"As much as I like my work, I really fear my periods of break.  I am a CS grad student, so all of my works are done behind a few monitors.  Every time I take a break, whether it be for lunch or for once-in-hours break, once I start taking a break, I get so absorbed into it that I cannot get out of it. Most commonly, I watch YouTube videos (streams &amp; stuff) during breaks because I don't know what else to do during the break and I find this activity the most amusing.  I have tried using a timer, but I tend to give myself extra few minutes over and over, and eventually not stopping, ugh! I also heard having a regular schedule might help, but I'm not sure how to set a regular schedule given that my work only involves research (no workout, nada) and it's difficult to get out of break in the first place.\n\nI don't know if this is common, but I am the guy who gets immersed into work very quickly and likes to continue working straight, until my day's work gets to the end. Yes, I prefer work without breaks.  However, people say it's important to take breaks, and there is also some unskippable breaks like lunch and dinner.  What is the way to have a healthy break that does not break my work momentum?\n\nNow, some may recommend working out, but I unfortunately am a \"strong\" at-home person and doesn't really like working out.  I think break should be giving me some dopamine, but workout should give me near-zero dopamine, while YouTubing gives me enticingly high amount of dopamine.

{"id":"11v1z0j","timestamp":1679097600000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"My 2 year program has a cohort of 30 people and I feel like I’m always finding out about gatherings after the fact. Last semester, I consistently saw Snapchat\/IG stories and updates on bar hang outs, games, and more literally every week. Sometimes even more. But they were usually during or after the event. I tried to participate but how am I supposed to attend if I had no idea it was happening? And it’d get awkward when I was asking “what’s going on?” or “what are you guys talking about?”. Someone once even said “Poor (my name), she keeps thinking there’s a group chat for this when we plan it spontaneously”. I just get left out because no one tells me. I get that I’m more introverted, but I really do try to talk and participate in conversations and have been mistaken as an extrovert by an extrovert before. I’ve really worked on this over the years. And other introverts in the class somehow also find out about the events, parties, and gatherings. \n\nPart of me felt ok - I tried to make myself feel better by saying that those people just don’t have a life outside of the program. And that I wanted to have more of a balance. Seeing the same people 5 days a week a day PLUS some evenings and most weekends is a lot! On top of 5-6 classes and student clubs and volunteering, I have a GA position, casual job, serious relationship, family, and other friends to balance. I feel ridiculous and in the minority for feeling this way. \n\nNow that it’s March, there seems to be less of these events happening second semester, but it still hurts when someone sends a video or picture (e.g. group selfie) to the cohort group text and it’s like almost everybody is in it. This literally happened last night at 2AM for someone’s st patty party. I can’t silent the notifications or not check because sometimes there are important announcements to know. I try to shrug it off and not let it get to me but I feel ashamed that I’ve cried over this before.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello there!
