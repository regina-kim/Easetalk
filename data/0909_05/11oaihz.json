This is your opportunity to let your research shine.\n\nMoving forward, why not set up a couple of mock sessions with your friends before the presentation date? That way, you can get comfortable answering unexpected questions while keeping the focus on your main points. And through this process, be gentle with yourself; it's all part of sharpening your skills.\n\nYou've got this, and I'll be here to support you along the way. Keep me updated on how your preparations go, and let's check in soon to discuss how everything's progressing. You're doing a fantastic job taking proactive steps to achieve your goals!",

  "concern": "title: How to handle hostile listeners when presenting?\nI am a 1st year grad student and am currently preparing to present my research to the rest of my research group for the first time. While I am confident in my ability to field genuine questions about my work, I am anxious about dealing with one senior group member in particular.\n\nHaving been in this lab since undergrad, I routinely see him ask questions to presenters in group meeting that are intended to sow discomfort or undermine their confidence. It comes across as juvenile, in the sense that I don't believe he is asking out of legitimate curiosity but rather as a way to assert dominance among his peers. They tend to be tedious, hardly important questions, often requiring back-tracking after the presenter has moved on.\n\nHow have you dealt with people like this in your time in grad school? I don't want him to walk all over me, else he'll interpret me as an easy target and bother me more in the future. At the same time, I don't want to harm my reputation with an unprofessional response.",
