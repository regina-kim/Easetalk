  "concern": "title: Mastering out of a PhD program late?\nSo I'm a Bio PhD in the US. I'm in my 6th year and last year of stipend funding. If I continue, I'm likely going to need at least a few months where I'm going to have to work outside the department while finishing the PhD unpaid. So much shit has happened while in the program. My wife almost died, my in-laws died in a car accident, I've been facing mental health issues throughout, and that lovely pandemic happened. I still haven't even started writing yet....it's just so many experiments that have either failed or required so much optimization (don't do enzyme work. It sucks). My boss doesn't believe in me, and I'm just a constant ball of anxiety and depression. Some days I'm feeling really down. I'm starting to think for my own mental health if I should just take the L, master out, and just move on into an entry-level industry job. I think I just really need to get away from academia. How does mastering out late into a PhD look on a CV/resume, and how can you recover? Is a career in the sciences dead (I still LOVE Biology. I just don't want to be miserable 24/7 anymore).",
