You might also consider setting up a regular time to chat, which can make it feel more natural and less one-sided. \n\nTo support you in this, let's focus on building a small plan: you could start by drafting a message or thinking about what you might say when you reach out. Perhaps something simple and honest about needing a bit more connection. \n\nRemember, it's perfectly okay to express your need for support. You're taking a positive step toward your well-being, and that's something to be proud of. If you ever feel unsure or need to talk more about how it went, know that you can always reach out here.

  "concern": "title: Feeling very lonely\nI am in a program to start my dream career. But grad school is hard, and there have been so many complications (personal and in the program) that have come up. I always try to do my best with keeping on. But the loneliness is really getting to me. My parents don't support me or ask how I am doing. My mom is angry that I am not cleaning or cooking as much as I used to. I am helping my brother in a program he is in, and he is not taking responsibility and not listening to me (my parents are not stepping in). \n\nAnd on top of that, I don't hear from my big group of friends (which I am realizing are now acquaintances). They don't check in on me, one does once in a while and we may hang out but I have to organize it. I am so exhausted from having to go through life alone. It feels like no one cares about me, and that I get no support. Just last week my family was in crisis, and I didn't know who to turn to. My bestie often responds hours after and another person who I thought was a good friend often invalidates me and tells me to focus on whats perfect. I thought huh, maybe I should reach out to a crisis line.\n\nPeople keep telling me I need to be patient, and I should be happy. But Im just exhausted and easily upset. So, is anyone else lonely? Burned out? What do you do?",
