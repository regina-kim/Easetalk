I'm doing well in it though and they already asked me to return for the summer. It's amazing how valued I feel there but I'm still having trouble feeling happy for this because I know my advisor isn't going to be happy. Even though they've shown repeatedly they only want me to be a means to their tenure I still want to make them happy. I don't get it. \n\nYou all have skills and value outside of academia though.
