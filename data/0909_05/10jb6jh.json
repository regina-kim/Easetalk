I am definitely going to do a master's but I'm not sure if I want to make the time commitment for a PhD just yet. My reason is that I don't want to take a break after getting my master's and then change my lifestyle again to go be a student. I want to study computational mathematics/ some combo of math + cs. Thanks!",
