  "concern": "title: Choosing a grad school: funding vs love\nI feel like I’m in an impossible situation so I’d love some advice from the community. \n\nI’ve been accepted at two good schools (top 15/20) for a PhD in astronomy/astrophysics. I am very grateful and lucky! I really like both schools but each has its pros and cons. \nHowever, school A is offering me a really nice fellowship and is a little bit more prestigious than school B. But school B is in a big city which I really like and most importantly my long term partner (who I hope to marry) got into a phd in physics there too. The funding situation isn’t great there for either of us. \n\nMy partner applied to school A and would prefer it over school B but he hasn’t heard back yet. We both assume he’s been rejected. I feel like I should choose school B but I will be giving up a better funding situation and great opportunity at A. \n\nFor context I don’t really know yet exactly what I want to do after the phd. Something in research ofc (that’s why I’m going) but not necessarily in academia. Also my partner is an excellent student and researcher but an international student so he has been having a hard time getting into programs. \n\nWhat should I do? Should I tell school A about my partner? Which should I choose?\n\nThanks for any advice.",
