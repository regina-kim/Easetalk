  "concern": "title: Need some helpful advise/encouragement?\nI have been in a pre-med post bac for a year now and decided that med school is not for me after a very challenging year and getting grades that tanked my GPA (not failing grades but adequate Cs). The school provides the option to transition from this program to a masters program however , a requirement of 3.0 GPA is needed. I am trying to switch academic paths, and it seems almost impossible for me to raise two, 5-credit hour courses that I earned Cs in. Meaning I need to get A’s in all of my classes this semester of 10 credits. This is kinda unrealistic for me as I have never achieved “straight A’s” in my academic career, and being in STEM, it’s really really hard to. For whatever reason, experiencing COVID during the later half of my undergraduate career has not set me up for grad school. I am trying to figure out new study habits and have been improving my grades as I retook a class while working part time. But I still have doubt I can achieve As in my classes. Any advice would be appreciated.",
