  "concern": "title: Work life balance during a PhD in organic chemistry?\nHello all,\n\nI have been lucky to spend this past year of mine doing a post-baccalaureate at a well known university, but even more importantly, with amazingly supportive and flexible advisors. The lab I work in doesn't have any strict hours, and half the people don't even show up on the weekend (and those that do, don't do it every single weekend). Having seen the labs at my undergrad (and the 70+ hrs/week students put in there), I know this idea of a *genuine* work life balance is often times thought of as a myth, however, now that I've been exposed to how wonderful things *could* be, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the fact that most labs in most schools simply don't operate that way.\n\nI want to get my PhD in organic, and currently I have an offer from a good school that I'm considering (Boston College), however, it seems that most labs/PIs there (and elsewhere) are fairly strict about the minimum 6 days a week BS, and some even enforce minimum hours/day. \n\nI personally think that if you're good about time management and planning things out then coming in on the weekend should be more of a rarity, but most profs don't feel that way.\n\nI guess I'm wondering if anyone else has been able to achieve a genuine/healthy work life balance doing their PhD in chemistry, and if so, how did you approach this with your advisor? Were they aware that you weren't in 24/7? Did you say something to them to establish this boundary? I'm not sure what I should be looking for/if it's a possibility that I could find something similar to the lab I'm currently at.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot stay in this lab/school, so I have to consider other options.\n\nThanks in advance!",
