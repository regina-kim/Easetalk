  "concern": "title: Value of a Bachelors Degree in SCS\nHello,\n\nCurrently looking at transferring to the Georgetown School of Continued Studies (SCS) for my bachelors degree.\n\nI currently work full-time in finance (i have a graduation return offer) and as such, have struggled significantly with my current situation (attending class in person, being a full time student). My grades have struggled as the result of (trying) to balance full time employment with full time academics. It is for this reason I am considering the GU SCS (which offers classes fully online).\n\nProblem is, I intend on attending law or grad school down the line. I want to see if attending such a program will hinder my chances. To clarify, it is not another example of the Harvard Extension School. My diploma will say simply that I graduated from Georgetown. However, I wanted to see if this would change the way employers, law schools and grad schools see me.\n\n",
