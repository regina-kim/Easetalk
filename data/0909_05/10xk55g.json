I put my life on hold to complete all the prereqs and I finally got in! It has always been my dream of being a crna. \n\nHowever, my bf is discouraging me to become a crna because of the debt I’ll have. I’ll have around 100-200k in debt but by the time I’ll become a crna I’ll also be making around 150-200k+. He says that most of my income will go to taxes and I make the same as a bedside RN.. He says I won’t be able to enjoy life and spend all my time working. I won’t be able to pay off my debt till 40-50 and I won’t have a good life. \n\nHe instead thinks that I should just take an easy nursing job and help him buy a house. He tells me I would be able to live a easy life and that I’ll be provided for. \n\nWhat do you guys think of this?",
