Remember, most PIs appreciate enthusiasm and genuine interest in their work.\n\nRelying on your cohort for support can also help keep things in perspective. They might have insights or strategies from their own experiences. As you move forward with this plan, remind yourself that reaching out is a step toward creating those connections and opportunities you’re looking for.\n\nI’m really encouraged by your proactive approach and hopeful perspective.

  "concern": "title: Panicking about not finding a permanent lab after rotations\nI'm freaking out. This is my first year of grad school and in my program (bio) you rotate through up to 3 labs before choosing where to stay permanently. I started my #2 rotation recently and thought all was good. However, the PI told me on day 1 of the rotation that the funding situation had changed for the worse and he couldn't commit to keeping me on longterm. I couldn't believe it because I had asked about this before rotating. No matter though, I can go back to lab #1 though right? NOPE, turns out that PI said almost word for word the same thing.\n\nI don't think this is about my performance since the #2 PI told me before I had even had a chance to do any work. Also, we have a group Whatsapp chat for our cohort and a lot of people are hearing similar things. One person's rotation PI said it is because there was a protest and stipends went up by a lot so PIs are now saying they can't afford to take new people on.\n\nI can't stop picturing the worst outcomes. What if I can't find a lab, do I have to drop out of the program? I gave up so much to come here, broke my lease, quit my job, even ended a relationship. What do I do?",
