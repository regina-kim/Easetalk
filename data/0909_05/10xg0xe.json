  "concern": "title: Psychology B.A.- Seeking Advice\nI graduated in 2021 with my B.A. in psychology. I am now trying to put it to use, but discovering that working in the mental health field is something I no longer have any interest in. \n\nI feel really confused right now because I am unsure what to do with this B.A. because I don't want to a) go into debt to try &amp; get my master's considering becoming a clinician, counselor, etc is something I don't want to do anymore..., b) I am contemplating pursuing a PhD, but I would like to switch subjects because I do enjoy learning, being in school, but I don't know how I can apply to a different area of subject for my PhD since I have a psychology B.A, would it even be worth it or possible? Would I have to get another undergraduate degree since I have no volunteer, research, or barely any work experience? \n\nOverall, I am really lost and confused and grad school seems like the \"answer\" but I don't want to choose pursing a PhD for the wrong reasons and waste time going back to school just to later still feel unsure, and lost as I do now. I recently turned 25 and I don't know what path to take of choosing to further my educational path or not. I have a passion for learning, and being in the classroom, teaching and love of exchanging ideas but teaching doesn't pay the bills either.... if anyone has any advice I would be so glad to hear it : )",
