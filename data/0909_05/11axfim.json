  "concern": "title: Withdrawing for Semester With Just My Paper Left\nI've in my third year in an English grad program. I've completed all of my coursework, I've defended my prospectus. I just need to write my Master's Paper. However, my mental state has been so rough these psst two months, I haven't been able to even work with my data. My advisor knows I've been struggling this semester but I havent gotten anything other than data collection done. I cannot bring myself to do any writing or reading or any kind of work. Im burntout and alternate between extreme depression and horrific anxiety. I know if I try and continue with trying to do my paper in addition to work and externals factors it'll just lead to frustration and disappointment for myself and my advisor. I already see myself acting in ways that are self destructive and i know i need to talk with my doctor about my medication and (likely) get back into therapy. That said, how stupid will it seem if I do withdraw for the semester? I think I need time where my paper isn't an added weight to my current stressors (which I do believe I also fixate on instead of doing the work I need to do) but I don't know how badly this could reflect on me.\n\nIt wouldn't be forever, I just need until the summer or fall semester to return to this work.\n\nI don't want to fish for validation- how bad of a decision could this be? I'm afraid the few people I've told are coddling me by telling me it's okay if i need to do this.",
