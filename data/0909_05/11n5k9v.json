I’ve been doing this masters for almost 2 years and I still don’t have conclusive data, she wants me to graduate asap because she does not want to continue supporting me financially (her words) but she can’t entirely kick me out just yet. I’ve had the worst years mentally speaking and I feel like everything I do, every experiment and plan are just one fail after another. Every meeting she tells me how I am not at the level of a graduate student and at this point I do not know what to do, I feel like a failure and I’m afraid I will continue being a failure when I graduate. I don’t like my project anymore and even looking at my data gives me anxiety. I just want to feel normal again, to the days where If I did a mistake at work it was pointed out and resolved, but here every mistake sends me into a spiral of self-doubt and low self steem. I hope it does get better if/when I graduate",
