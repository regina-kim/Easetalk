I’m sleeping so little just to get by in these classes. I don’t know if I can even make it to finals. \n\nHas anyone withdrawn from an entire semester of PhD classes? Did it affect your future employment or did it seemed frowned upon in interviews? \n\nIt’s too late to drop so these classes will still show up on my transcript and I am worried I’ll have to explain to interviewers why I quit in the middle of the semester.",
