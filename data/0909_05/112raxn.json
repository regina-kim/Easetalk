This approach might just help you feel more settled and energized. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection.\n\nNext, we can put together a schedule that aligns with these ideas and adjust as needed. You're taking meaningful steps towards managing the overwhelm, and that’s commendable. Keep holding onto the thought that taking care of yourself is just as important as tackling your tasks. Looking forward to exploring this further with you.",

  "concern": "title: Bumbling through the admissions cycle\nSo this is my second admissions cycle applying to MA and Ph.D. programs. I was accepted to a couple of programs last year but didn't receive enough funding, so did not enroll. I've mostly decided that I won't go through another cycle if I don't get enough funding this year because the rest of my life has been in limbo while trying to determine if I'm moving/departing from my LTR/etc. I could change my mind after a week of good rest but who knows when that will be.\n\nPart of me also feels so tired from the whole process. I work full time and was taking classes part-time for a number of years and then doing all of this freelance work to build my CV *and then* working on my application materials. I've been extremely lucky in that I did very well in my classes and also had a ton of opportunities come my way. I love learning and researching so much, and wish to be doing it full-time instead of splitting my efforts. I've already been through a 1-year grad program, and know how intense that year was. The work itself doesn't phase me since I'm used to working 50 - 60 hours a week between my job and whatever else I get myself into. Okay, I'm a bit of a workaholic. And I am legitimately tired. \n\nI also feel like I am stumbling through the admissions process even though I had some guidance (non-profit program for underserved students). The admissions process is not intuitive and sometimes I feel like a deer in headlights, and I spend days cringing over a wrong step. Anyone else?",
