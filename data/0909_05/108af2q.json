  "concern": "title: Tips and Tricks to Avoid Procrastinating\nLast semester entering my second year, I started off good and while dealing with depression, anxiety, and addictions, the semester kinda spiraled. I realized I got to a point where the day OF one of my classes final papers was due I stated the assignment (the liar in my head that says “ah I work well under pressure or ah I can do it last minute and still get a good grade”) not anymore. I waited and waited for who knows what to start that assignment and I had the worst time of my life. I’m traumatized. I was so stressed out finals week that I threw up from nausea, had major major anxiety, pretty much broke down half way and started ending my sentences midway because I just could not keep going for the life of me. That level of stress was traumatic and I know it’s my fault. I need to make changes. I promised myself if I did that to myself again I would drop out. And since I have Qualifying exams this semester, I’m like SpongeBobs brain, all chaos. All I can think about are my professors thinking “how did she get in with this work? Or just thinking the worst of my capabilities. Which I also feel like I’ve partly lost. My writing was so good before, now it’s hard to make a sentence sound good enough. I bombed those finals so hard, when I think about it I get anxiety again. I feel kinda numb too, I’m worried that I didn’t really panic knowing those papers were due that day. Not panicking means I’m not caring anymore and that’s scaring me. Factors like being far away from home and being lonely in a new city with no real friends, mental health struggles, and life in general has been bumpy for all of us the last two years. Have any of you experienced this stress trauma before? How have you dealt with it? Or if you have any tips on being productive and avoid procrastinating please let me know. I’m desperate. I don’t want to end up hating my career bc of grad school. I LOVE what I do, I love being an archaeologist, I can’t see myself doing anything other than that. Which is why dropping out of grad school is NOT a choice. I have to finish, but I need help managing it all along the way. Thanks in advance.",
