Focusing on becoming familiar with one piece of equipment at a time can really help you build your confidence incrementally. It’s great to hear that you're open to changing how you talk to yourself when mistakes happen, viewing them as opportunities to learn and grow is such an empowering approach. \n\nYou’re setting yourself up for success with these strategies. Remember that progress takes time and it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Keep acknowledging your efforts and the progress you're making, no matter how small it seems. \n\nThe next step could be to schedule some time each week to reflect on what you’ve learned and celebrate those wins. I'm here to support you along the way, so feel free to reach out if you need to talk or adjust your plan. You're doing great, and I'm confident in your ability to navigate this with resilience and grace.",

  "concern": "title: Are you nervous or confident in lab?\nToday my partner came to keep me company while I was working late in lab. I noticed how intrigued he was by everything in our lab (he is not in science or any science adjacent field). He was walking around touching all the instruments we had out, poking around (being mindful to not break or change anything) and was overall just very interested. \n\nIt made me think: not even I go around poking around my lab because I'm worried I'll break something. Even when I come across an issue in lab (this is my first time doing labwork in years), I email my advisors for help instead of poking around old data to see if anything matches up because I don't want to accidentally delete something.\n\nI guess it will take time to gain more confidence and I should probably up my anxiety meds but how are you usually in lab? Nervous or confidently inquisitive? I want to become like the latter but worried (ha) that I will never break out of my nervous shell.",
