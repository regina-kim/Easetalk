  "concern": "title: Mastering out\nHi Everyone!\n\nI currently attend an Ed.S dual degree program where I receive a M.Ed and Ed.S. I am 2.5/3 years in. As of December I have received an email from my program head stating that our cohort were “granted our M.Ed but won’t receive it in May” due to meeting the requirements of Ed.S then and receiving them both then. \n\n(Vent time; Question on the bottom)\n\nThe remaining of my time in the program and within the last year in clinical… has made me realize I’ve sacrificed so much of my mental health. I had an impromptu eval from my site supervisor Friday where she plainly asked me “Do you even want to be here?” Through this evaluation crushed me, it’s made me realize that I may not want to be here. As I’m sure as most academic personalities, I place such a high standard on myself that Ive realized placed in me in toxic academic environments and dealing with grad personnel within these environments. To the point where I’ve forgotten about my mental health by only thinking about the future, where I need to start thinking about the present me. Many in my life have been telling me to stick it out, but I’ve had this mindset for the last 2 years. I’m genuinely tired of sticking it out in a career where I’ve lost passion for. (Okay, vent time over)\n\nOverall, I’m planning on mastering out. So my general question is, could I still plan to master out if my M.Ed is granted but it won’t be conferred until May of 2023? I’m afraid my program head will prevent me from receiving it.",
