  "concern": "title: Should I join a PhD program just to get housing? \nI started my M.Sc last year. This year I am switching advisors to pursue a thesis that my old advisor didn’t have expertise in. \n\nGrad school was very hard for me because I had to commute 2 hours and a half, each time going and returning. It took a toll on me and I think that giving my best for the research I want to do isn’t possible without housing near the university (which is secluded). \n\n\nWhen I joined for my M.Sc, I tried to ask the graduate school administration to help me and they were absolutely unwilling to help me even as an international student. \n\nMy program provides housing to PhD students and not for Master students. \n\nShould I tell the PI im interested in that I want to join the PhD program, if there aren’t other applicants. Do I tell her the full truth? A half truth? \n\nI wouldn’t mind joining the PhD program but I am not sure if this is the road for me and it’s scary to commit. I’m open to trying? How much information should I give my PI? \n\nI don’t want to take from the research grant funds more than what is owed for the work that  I would be doing. \n\n",
