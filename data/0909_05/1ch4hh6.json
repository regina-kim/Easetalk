  "concern": "title: Those who went back to school for a more rewarding career change, was it worth it? Any advice on my situation is appreciated\nI'm a 23y/o woman seeking a career change. I graduated in 2021 with a BA in Communication Science and Rhetorical Studies, along with a certificate in Digital Studies and History.\n\nCurrently, I work as a technical writer for a Silicon Valley tech startup. While the pay is good, the work environment is far from fulfilling. I work with software and Al, and truthfully it's quite soul crushing. I don't measure success solely by income, although still important, I'm really eager to pursue something that aligns more with my interests and makes some kind of meaningful impact.\n\nMy primary interest lies in research and academia, particularly in sociology or religious theology. I've always been fascinated by the history of religion's influence on global affairs, social development, government regulation, etc. I spend most of my free time reading on these topics. However, I'm aware of the challenges in these fields: they're highly competitive, underfunded, and aren't expected to grow. (Rip humanities)\n\nBeyond academia, I'm open to exploring other fulfilling paths such as public policy, government, or the medical field. However, I'm uncertain where to begin in discovering options in these fields that I could pursue.\nI'm willing to pursue further education through a master's or doctorate to make this career switch, but I want to be sure it's not a dead end. Currently, I'm still paying off my undergraduate loans ($25,000 remaining).\n\nI suppose I'm really looking for advice from those who have been in a similar situation. With my current background, where can I go from here without net to start from scratch? I really need to get out of Silicur Valley world and the people in it. Apologies for the long post, and thanks in advance to all.\n",
