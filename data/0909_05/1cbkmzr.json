Alongside, consider setting some time to brainstorm potential obstacles and think of strategies to overcome them.\n\nRemember, it’s important to pace yourself and acknowledge even small progress as a victory. You have a strong vision and determination, and with these steps, you’re well-equipped to move forward.

  "concern": "title: How tf do ya’ll afford this?\nI’m a pharmacy tech that wants to pursue my PharmD at some point. I’m 24F and have some health problems that make me think it would be smarter for me to have kids sooner rather than later. Is it doable to start grad school when my future kids are school-age so that I at least have 8 hours of my day free for school/studying? I know *some* companies are willing to help with tuition a bit and there is a pharmacy intern license that can give me a slight raise for the duration of school but honestly, how do any of you afford grad school without parents helping a lot? Every school I’ve found says it’s about $100k.\n :( Fortunately I have nearly all the prereqs knocked out, except for a semester or two of STEM classes. I have an associates of arts, which I know, not great but my core is all done.",
