Embracing discipline with your writing targets might involve setting a consistent routine or rewarding yourself for reaching milestones. As for feedback, perhaps identifying specific people or groups you can reach out to could help. You’re taking steps that reflect resilience and commitment to your goals, which is truly commendable. Let's plan for you to begin scheduling regular writing times and consider a list of potential feedback resources. If you feel stuck, you could rely on simple techniques like breaking tasks into even smaller steps or taking short breaks to refresh your mind. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and taking it one step at a time is a great way to build momentum. How does focusing on these elements for the upcoming week feel for you?",

  "concern": "title: Starting my non-thesis paper\nSo it’s my last semester of my Master’s (History), assuming I graduate in May. I know I need to do more on my paper (AKA actually write it so I can finish it). I started in November, but only because I had a meeting with one of my advisors and needed to show where I was with my argument. I had about 15 or so pages done, mostly introduction but a brief overview of my main tenets. \n\nI sent this draft to this same advisor and he has NEVER gotten back to me with feedback despite in-person requests. He also never returned my seminar research paper with any feedback, (completed in December), despite multiple in-person requests. Nor did the historiography seminar paper I completed for another class (different professor) get returned with any feedback, despite an email request. \nMy other advisor, whom I work for as a research assistant, briefly talks to me about ideas but our conversations skew back towards their work 75% of the time. \n\nI’ve been reading endlessly, it seems, and have a clearer idea of where I want to take my argument. But I’m finding it hard to start writing again without receiving feedback for my last seminar papers, which contained the foundation l of my argument, my thoughts on the trajectory of the field, and what I feel like my contribution adds to my field.\n\nLooking for advice and encouragement on how to proceed when I feel like what I’m saying (and requesting in follow-up!) is clearly not worth anyone’s time.",
