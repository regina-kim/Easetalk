I was never really too close to them and wouldnâ€™t go to that many office hours since I never really needed to. A lot of the classes I took I would get Aâ€™s so I didnâ€™t really see the need to go to office hours and itâ€™s just weird to be there for non-class related reasons. I was involved with an extra-curricular so I didnâ€™t really get into any research. At this point am I screwed if I canâ€™t get any jobs and canâ€™t get a masters degree. ",
