Perhaps framing it around your shared goals or the progress you've both observed might help set a positive tone. As for tracking your progress, what if you created a simple progress chart or journal that highlights key achievements and areas of growth? This could provide a clear visual for both you and your advisor to discuss regularly.\n\nAs you continue with these steps, remember you've been doing an incredible job managing your health and academic responsibilities. It's okay to advocate for yourself and seek the support you need. Next time you meet with your advisor, focus on the positive outcomes you've achieved and express how much their acknowledgment would mean to you.\n\nYou've set some important goals, like initiating open conversations and establishing a feedback system. As you move forward, keep leaning into these strategies, and remember, progress, not perfection, is the key. If you ever feel overwhelmed, consider exploring relaxation techniques or reaching out for support from others who understand your journey.

  "concern": "title: my advisor was upset that i couldn't remember the name of the professor who is teaching one of my classes this semester\nMy advisor kinda hates me. He didn't like how my first year of PhD went; I had to spend a lot of time adjusting to the rigor of my program for which I honestly was not prepared. I also developed epilepsy and took awhile to find the right meds to quell the episodes, etc. In the midst, I got myself on probation due to a C. This prohibited me from sitting in for qualifier. Anyways, I have started to blossom particularly over the summer and now as a second year. Lexapro, lamictal, and my tenacity have been integral.\n\nMy professor was even really happy and surprised by how well one of my presentations to our industrial partner went. ANYWAYS, I was doing a routine meeting with him today (we meet maybe thrice a year) and he asked how my classes were going. I told that I honestly was feeling way more adjusted and having a lot of fun. I love my polymers class a lot and the professor there is a close acquaintance of mine.\n\nBut my other course, the professor is new and I simply never memorized his name. He is Chinese and his name is honestly hard for me to pronounce. I appreciate his class and ask questions actively because the material is one I engage in. I have no disrespect for him at all!\n\nMy advisor asked me about who was teaching the class this semester. I believe that I knew his name, but I was certain that I would mispronounce it. And I did not want to do this as it is disrespectful. Additionally, I have a lot of anxiety going into these meetings given my advisor's pre-eexisting disdain for me.  I just knew that what would come out of my mouth would be stutter or embarrassment. So I just blurted out, hmm I honestly don't remember. Lol. And my professor made this face and said, \"Ooh that is not good at all. Six weeks in and you don't know his name. Tsk tsk tsk with his mouth\". I just smiled and said, yep I don't remember.\n\nOh well. \n\noh and not a single question regarding how my epilepsy is, if it is still serving as a learning disability for me, etc. he's tenured and rightfully profit focused in our group",
