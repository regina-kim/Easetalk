{"id":"seeu31","timestamp":1643328000000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"I'm in a MA program right now and we just started in-person learning. Until this week, I had been at my parents' house doing online school from there. While I'm definitely not the biggest proponent of online school, I was actually really enjoying life at home. I got to focus on doing readings and work without worrying about maintaining my own living space, I didn't have a commute to and from classes, and I really enjoyed hanging out with my family every day. Now I'm in a different city which is still pretty shut down from the pandemic, living alone, I can't see anyone, I haven't been able to focus on my coursework that much, and I just feel really *lonely* especially since the people in my cohort aren't keen on getting together due to the pandemic. Even though I absolutely love my program and what I'm studying, I'm starting to question if it's worth the lifestyle choices that are necessary (e.g., moving away from home, the job search being global rather than local). Now, I'm finding myself wishing the weeks would pass until I can go back during the break. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way and how they cope with it. I'm also wondering if moving away for grad school is that much better if there weren't a pandemic shutting everything down\/limiting any social activities; especially since so many people refer to grad school as an isolating experience anyway.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello!

Would you like to explore who might be a good fit for this role, or think about how you'd like those check-ins to look?\nclient: Yeah, I think I'd like to explore that. Maybe I could talk to a couple of friends from my program and see if they're interested in doing something like that. It would be nice to have some kind of informal check-in system, like grabbing coffee and chatting about how we're managing everything.\ntherapist: That sounds like a solid approach. Would you like to set a goal for reaching out to those friends this week and perhaps decide on a regular check-in schedule that works for everyone?\nclient: Yeah, setting a goal sounds good. I'll try to reach out to them this week and see if they're interested. Maybe we can figure out a time that works for all of us to meet up regularly.\ntherapist: That sounds like a plan! How about we talk about what day you'll reach out and what your first check-in might look like?\nclient: client: I think I'll aim to reach out by Wednesday. As for the first check-in, maybe we can meet for coffee on campus, keep it casual, just to see how everyone's feeling about the workload and share any tips that've been helping us cope.\ntherapist: That sounds like a fantastic plan. You've set a clear goal to reach out by Wednesday, and it sounds like having these casual coffee check-ins will provide some much-needed support and perspective. Remember, setting boundaries around your work hours and prioritizing tasks can make a big difference in managing your stress. You're doing a great job taking these steps. Stay in touch with your friends for support and encouragement, and be kind to yourself as you adjust. Looking forward to hearing how it goes in our next session!\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate the encouragement. I'll try to keep that in mind and see how it goes with the check-ins.","completed":true}

Also, if people who join feel comfortable enough to share a bit about themselves, it might make others feel at ease to join in too.\ntherapist: Posting the link in forums and creating a welcoming environment sound like great steps. How would you like to start with spreading the word, and what might be some ways to encourage new members to share about themselves?\nclient: I think I’ll start by sharing it in a couple of Facebook groups and maybe even mention it to classmates. To encourage sharing, I could set the tone by introducing myself first and maybe have some icebreaker questions to get people talking.\ntherapist: That sounds like a solid plan! Starting with Facebook groups and classmates is a great step. How about setting a goal to post in two groups this week and choosing a couple of icebreaker questions to try out? What do you foresee as possible challenges, and how might you handle them?\nclient: Sure, setting a goal to post in two groups this week sounds doable. One challenge might be people just not engaging or seeing the post, so I guess I’d have to be patient and maybe try to keep the conversation going with whoever does join.\ntherapist: Being patient and keeping the conversation going are excellent strategies. How about setting up a plan to follow up with those who engage, and maybe consider an alternative way to reach out if the initial posts don't get much traction?\nclient: Yeah, following up is a good idea. I could message people individually who show interest or maybe ask for feedback on how to make the group more engaging. If the posts don't get much attention, I might try reaching out in person during classes or events to talk about it.\ntherapist: It sounds like you've got a solid plan in place to build your support system. Sharing in Facebook groups and with classmates, along with using icebreakers, are excellent steps. Setting a goal to post in two groups this week is a proactive approach. Remember, patience and persistence will be key if engagement is slow. Following up individually and asking for feedback are great ways to nurture connections. If needed, reaching out during classes or events can provide another avenue to spread the word. Keep up the great effort, and let's touch base next week to see how everything is progressing. You're doing a fantastic job taking initiative!\nclient: Thanks, I hope it all works out. I'll try to keep the momentum going and see what happens.","completed":true}
{"id":"119bwqj","timestamp":1677024000000,"category":"school_life","concern":"I graduated college less than a year ago (May 2022); and my undergraduate experience was already screwed up by COVID-19 - I was forced to skip out on a full year before returning to Senior year because the US did not allow international students to take hybrid classes and my university was not offering at least 3 in-person classes for me during the 2020 - 2021 lockdown. So I got to watch all my friends graduate without me; I did qualify for an accelerated Master's Program in Economics and I was accepted but I opted not to pursue it due to COVID-19 and feeling that I did not want to stay in Fordham for both undergraduate and graduate school.  \n\n\nAnyway, I somehow managed to get a short-term contract at the World Bank since they hired people from around the world, and if I work for the World Bank in a full-time job for about 15 years I am eligible for permanent residency (green card). For all intents and purposes I really want to stay and live and build a life in the US (especially now with geopolitical events in SE Asia). The problem is that I don't have options for employment in the private sector because the H1-b process is absurdly random and difficult; and the World Bank and IMF have outright told me that I can't get a fulltime job without AT LEAST a Master's Degree (it's already brutally difficult for me to get even a short-term contract role, let alone a fulltime job); and even this employment is not guaranteed.  \n\n\nI'm thinking of getting a Master's Degree in Statistics or Data Science (an MBA or Master's degree in economics isn't very helpful) but I have checked that I did not take enough undergrad courses in Math or Computer Science to qualify (at least in the US). I'm fairly certain that my math skills and coding skills are nowhere near good enough for grad school (I struggled for a 3.60 gpa even before COVID-19)  \nI'm honestly totally lost because I'm being forced to prepare for grad school so soon, just after I managed to find something solid career-wise (I'm 23 turning 24). Otherwise I have to go back to the Philippines and I probably won't have an opportunity to immigrate elsewhere anymore.  \n\n\nAny advice for my circumstances?","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello!

{"id":"1fwghnn","timestamp":1728086400000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"As the title says my roommate doesn’t clean up after themself. Now our room isn’t a complete disaster and it’s mainly their side (plus our bathroom but it’s kinda 70\/30 on who makes the most mess of it) but they just don’t really clean up. They have cups and cans and bottles all over their nightstand and desk and have even had a cup under their bed on the dresser before, and they’re never empty either. They also go home every weekend so they don’t really have dishes or real food here so they’re all Starbucks and Dunkin’ cups, so half full coffees just sitting there separating for weeks as they go home and come back. They do sorta clean it after a few weeks, I’ve seen them bag up the cups and other garbage, but they don’t take it out. They have bags full of garbage in the corner on their side of the room and our rooms not big so it’s starting to creep towards our closet almost in the way of it. As for the bathroom they leave hair everywhere and I know it’s theirs and not mine because it’s their little rubber bands with the hair. Now like I said I am also at fault for the the bathroom being messy but I try to keep it somewhat clean by taking out the garbage and have cleaned the shower drain but they don’t even try to clean up a bit. I don’t know how they don’t get embarrassed when they have a friend over or even just with me being here. I get embarrassed having 2 cans on my desk and a few dirty forks or spoons for a few days because I’m too tired to wash them yet. Otherwise they’re a good roommate it’s just they never clean. I should also say they had a single room last year so it definitely feels like part of the reason since they would be used to not sharing a space but I want to have friends over and I’m embarrassed for my roommate. I don’t really know how to tell them to take their garbage out without sounding like a bitch and I already accepted I’m gonna be cleaning our bathroom alone.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello!

Plus, it would definitely make me more comfortable inviting friends over, without having to worry about the state of the room.\ntherapist: It seems like having that conversation could really improve your living situation and social life. What do you think might be some of the longer-term benefits for you if you make this change?\nclient: I think in the long run, I might feel more confident in addressing issues directly, not just with my roommate but in other areas too. It could also mean a better relationship with my roommate since we'd have clearer communication and understanding.\ntherapist: It sounds like this change could really enhance your overall confidence and communication skills. How do you feel about taking the first steps towards making it happen?\nclient: client: Honestly, I'm a bit nervous about it, but I know it's something I need to do. I feel like once I start, it'll be easier to keep the momentum going and hopefully improve things.\ntherapist: Feeling nervous is completely normal, but it sounds like you have a strong understanding of the positive impact this change could have. What would help you feel more confident about starting the conversation?\nclient: Maybe having a game plan or some talking points could help, so I don't get lost in the moment. I guess just reminding myself of the benefits and knowing it's for the best could make it less daunting.\ntherapist: Having a game plan and talking points sounds like a great way to boost your confidence. Would you like to brainstorm some specific points to cover in that conversation, or maybe discuss some strategies for staying focused on the benefits during the talk?\nclient: Yeah, brainstorming some talking points would be super helpful. I think having a clear idea of what I want to say could keep me from getting sidetracked or feeling overwhelmed.\ntherapist: Great, let's create some key talking points together. Based on what you've mentioned, we can focus on the main benefits you see in making this change and perhaps outline how you want the conversation to flow. What do you think would be helpful to include?\nclient: client: I think it would be good to start by expressing how much I value our roommate relationship, so it doesn’t feel like I’m attacking them. Maybe then I can bring up the room and bathroom situation, just explaining how it affects me and suggesting some kind of regular cleaning schedule.\ntherapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. Starting with appreciation sets a positive tone, and discussing the impact on you can help communicate your needs clearly. How about we also think of a couple of ways to suggest the cleaning schedule that keeps it collaborative?\nclient: client: Yeah, that sounds smart. Maybe we could suggest alternating weeks for trash duty or setting a reminder to tidy up before weekends. I just want it to feel fair and not like I'm bossing them around.\ntherapist: It sounds like you've developed a solid plan with key talking points to help guide your conversation with your roommate. You’ve got a great start by valuing your relationship and focusing on the impact of the living situation on your comfort. Your idea of alternating cleaning duties and setting reminders is a fair and collaborative approach, which aligns with your goal to maintain a positive relationship.\n\nAs you prepare for this conversation, remember to practice your talking points to enhance your confidence and ensure you feel ready. It’s important to choose a relaxed time to talk to help keep the dialogue positive and open. \n\nYou're taking a proactive step that can enhance your living situation and personal growth. If you need further support, don't hesitate to reach out. You're on the right path, and I have confidence in your ability to handle this.\nclient: Thanks, I'll definitely give the practice a try. I'll reach out if I need more guidance.","completed":true}
{"id":"11ro6p7","timestamp":1678838400000,"category":"academic","concern":"As much as I like my work, I really fear my periods of break.  I am a CS grad student, so all of my works are done behind a few monitors.  Every time I take a break, whether it be for lunch or for once-in-hours break, once I start taking a break, I get so absorbed into it that I cannot get out of it. Most commonly, I watch YouTube videos (streams &amp; stuff) during breaks because I don't know what else to do during the break and I find this activity the most amusing.  I have tried using a timer, but I tend to give myself extra few minutes over and over, and eventually not stopping, ugh! I also heard having a regular schedule might help, but I'm not sure how to set a regular schedule given that my work only involves research (no workout, nada) and it's difficult to get out of break in the first place.\n\nI don't know if this is common, but I am the guy who gets immersed into work very quickly and likes to continue working straight, until my day's work gets to the end. Yes, I prefer work without breaks.  However, people say it's important to take breaks, and there is also some unskippable breaks like lunch and dinner.  What is the way to have a healthy break that does not break my work momentum?\n\nNow, some may recommend working out, but I unfortunately am a \"strong\" at-home person and doesn't really like working out.  I think break should be giving me some dopamine, but workout should give me near-zero dopamine, while YouTubing gives me enticingly high amount of dopamine.

{"id":"11v1z0j","timestamp":1679097600000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"My 2 year program has a cohort of 30 people and I feel like I’m always finding out about gatherings after the fact. Last semester, I consistently saw Snapchat\/IG stories and updates on bar hang outs, games, and more literally every week. Sometimes even more. But they were usually during or after the event. I tried to participate but how am I supposed to attend if I had no idea it was happening? And it’d get awkward when I was asking “what’s going on?” or “what are you guys talking about?”. Someone once even said “Poor (my name), she keeps thinking there’s a group chat for this when we plan it spontaneously”. I just get left out because no one tells me. I get that I’m more introverted, but I really do try to talk and participate in conversations and have been mistaken as an extrovert by an extrovert before. I’ve really worked on this over the years. And other introverts in the class somehow also find out about the events, parties, and gatherings. \n\nPart of me felt ok - I tried to make myself feel better by saying that those people just don’t have a life outside of the program. And that I wanted to have more of a balance. Seeing the same people 5 days a week a day PLUS some evenings and most weekends is a lot! On top of 5-6 classes and student clubs and volunteering, I have a GA position, casual job, serious relationship, family, and other friends to balance. I feel ridiculous and in the minority for feeling this way. \n\nNow that it’s March, there seems to be less of these events happening second semester, but it still hurts when someone sends a video or picture (e.g. group selfie) to the cohort group text and it’s like almost everybody is in it. This literally happened last night at 2AM for someone’s st patty party. I can’t silent the notifications or not check because sometimes there are important announcements to know. I try to shrug it off and not let it get to me but I feel ashamed that I’ve cried over this before.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome! I'm glad you're here.

Plus, focusing on the fact that I might make a new friend should be motivating.\ntherapist: Focusing on the potential to make a new friend sounds like a great motivator. Would you like to set a specific day this week to reach out, and perhaps think about what you might say to initiate the hangout?\nclient: client: Hmm, maybe I’ll aim for Thursday or Friday since things are usually less hectic for me then. As for what to say, I guess something simple like, \"Hey, do you want to grab coffee or study together sometime?\" would work. Keeping it casual should help with the nerves.\ntherapist: It sounds like you have a solid plan in place. Aiming to reach out on Thursday or Friday with a simple invitation to coffee or a study session seems like a great way to start building those connections. Remember, keeping it casual is key, and focusing on the possibility of making a new friend can be a great motivator. You've got this, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Also, having a few connections in place, even if they're just online at first, might make things less overwhelming when I get there.\ntherapist: That sounds like a great plan to ease the transition. How do you plan on getting to know the city and making those initial connections?\nclient: I think I'll start by doing some research online, like looking into neighborhoods, public transport, and events that might be happening. Maybe I can join some online groups or forums related to the university or city; it could be a good way to meet people ahead of time and get some local tips.\ntherapist: Based on what you've mentioned, starting with online research and joining groups sounds like a solid approach. How do you feel about setting a goal to explore a certain number of neighborhoods or join a specific number of forums this week?\nclient: client: Yeah, setting some goals could really help me stay focused and proactive. I might aim to explore a couple of neighborhoods virtually and join at least two online forums or groups this week. That should give me a good start.\ntherapist: That sounds like a great way to begin. How about we put that into an action plan? You could decide on which neighborhoods to explore and find specific forums to join. Do you foresee any challenges you might encounter with this plan?\nclient: I think the main challenge might be just finding the time to fit it all in with everything else going on, like finishing up stuff here before the move. Also, it might be tough to get a real feel for places just online. But I guess it's a start, and I can adjust as I go.\ntherapist: That makes sense. Perhaps we can plan to set aside specific times for your research and forum activities each week to help manage your schedule. How does that sound to you?\nclient: Yeah, setting specific times could make it feel more manageable and less overwhelming. I think having a structured plan might actually give me a bit more peace of mind with everything else that's happening.\ntherapist: It sounds like you have a clear plan in place. You've decided to virtually explore a couple of neighborhoods and join at least two forums this week, which is a solid start. By setting specific times for these activities, you're likely to find it more manageable amidst your current responsibilities. Remember, it's okay to adjust your approach as you learn more. Keep up the great work and stay flexible. If you need any further support or want to talk through your progress, feel free to reach out. You've got this!\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate the support. I'll give it my best shot and try to adjust if needed.","completed":true}

I was previously academically dismissed and worked so hard to get back into my college and I did! The community college classes I took in the time between was so easy and I didn’t really learn to cultivate better habits as I was able to quickly do work and still get As, which felt good, but not the same at a 4 year college. I have been diagnosed with ADHD\/ anxiety\/ depression since the 5th grade and didn’t start utilizing accommodations until high school. Used them and did great. College is another story as I started to having to advocate for myself and thought all of my negative symptoms were how everyone felt and who I was. I never saw those things as barriers, but as I have gotten older, the dots have started clicking. I have been embarrassed to use my accommodations until this year because past friends made comments that it’s unfair and I took those to heart. The academic resource center purged my files upon my dismissal so it’s been a mess trying to get the correct documentation and my doctor only sent in the documentation last week even though I was asking for months. I am very frustrated as I’ve been falling behind due to my mental health rapidly declining this semester upon starting a new medication that made everything worse: insomnia, more anxiety, not taking care of myself, thoughts of unaliving myself, and started c*tting myself for a few weeks. I started to make the connection that it was my new med I started and then cut it cold Turkey and have felt better, but I’m still in a disassociative state making functioning hard. I am scared to disclose all of this as I can’t afford to medically withdraw and am supposed to graduate in the spring.

I'm glad you're here. Please feel free to share anything that's on your mind or any concerns you might have.\nclient: Hey, thanks for having me. I'm just really overwhelmed with school and my mental health right now, and I feel like I'm kind of stuck in a loop.\ntherapist: It sounds tough feeling overwhelmed and stuck. Could you share more about what's been weighing on you with school and your mental health?\nclient: client: Yeah, it's just been a lot to juggle between trying to keep up with classes and dealing with my mental health getting worse. I thought I was managing okay, but it kind of spiraled recently, and I'm struggling to keep up.\ntherapist: It seems like you're feeling a lot of pressure trying to balance everything, and it's become overwhelming. What do you think led to things spiraling recently?\nclient: client: I think it started when I switched medications. I thought it would help, but it made everything worse, and now I'm just trying to pick up the pieces and catch up with everything.\ntherapist: Switching medications and feeling worse sounds really challenging. How do you envision things changing if you could find a better balance with school and your mental health?\nclient: I just want to feel in control again and not be constantly worried about falling behind. It'd be nice to handle my schoolwork without it feeling like it's this massive weight on me all the time.\ntherapist: That desire to regain control and lighten the weight sounds really important to you. What small steps do you think could help you start moving toward that sense of control?\nclient: Maybe I can start by setting up a more structured daily routine to help me stay on track and using my accommodations more effectively. Also, I think reaching out to professors to explain my situation might help ease some of the academic pressure.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're identifying some practical steps. How do you feel about reaching out to your professors and setting up that routine?\nclient: I feel a bit anxious about reaching out to them because I worry about being judged or seen as making excuses. As for the routine, I think it could help, but I’m worried about sticking to it, especially on rough days.\ntherapist: Your concerns about judgment and sticking to a routine seem really valid. How might taking these steps align with your broader goals of feeling more in control?\nclient: I guess taking these steps could help me feel a bit more organized and less overwhelmed, which would be a step toward feeling more in control. If I can manage to communicate my needs and have a routine, maybe I'd start to feel like I'm not just constantly scrambling to keep up.\ntherapist: It sounds like having a structured routine and communicating with your professors could be key steps towards your goal of feeling more in control. Would it be helpful to discuss how you might approach these actions and any specific strategies to ease those feelings of anxiety and ensure you can maintain the routine, even on tough days?\nclient: Yeah, I think having some strategies in mind would be really helpful. It would be great to have a plan for communicating with my professors and keeping up the routine, especially when things get tough.\ntherapist: Based on what you said, possible options could include setting small, manageable goals for communication, like drafting emails or setting specific times to reach out, and creating a flexible routine that allows for adjustments on tougher days. How does that sound to you?\nclient: That sounds like a really good starting point. Having smaller goals feels less overwhelming and a flexible routine could definitely help on days when things aren't going as planned.\ntherapist: Would you like to identify a specific goal for your communication or routine to start with, and think about what steps you might take to put these plans into action?\nclient: Yeah, that sounds like a smart move. Maybe starting with drafting an email to one of my professors could be a good first goal, and we could figure out what steps to include in that.\ntherapist: That sounds like a great first step. Perhaps we could outline the key points you want to include in the email and decide when you’d like to send it. How does that sound?\nclient: Yeah, outlining the key points would be really helpful. I think having a rough draft of what to say would make it feel less daunting. \ntherapist: You've made a solid plan today by deciding to draft an email to your professor, which is a great first step towards managing your workload and reducing stress. Remember, you've got a flexible routine now to adjust on challenging days, which should help keep things balanced. Be proud of yourself for recognizing what you need and taking action. When you're ready, go ahead with the email draft; that will be a significant move forward. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need more guidance or support. You've got this!\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate the encouragement. I'll definitely work on that draft and try to keep things balanced.\ntherapist: You're doing great by taking these proactive steps.

What do you think might help you move towards having that extra time and feeling more relaxed?\nclient: Honestly, I think adjusting my work schedule might help. If I could have more time during the week to catch up on my studies, it might ease some of the pressure.\ntherapist: Based on what you've said, one option could be to talk to your manager about adjusting your work schedule. Another could be planning specific study time blocks on days you have more flexibility. What do you think about these possibilities, or is there another approach you’d like to explore?\nclient: I think talking to my manager could be a good start. I just worry about losing hours or how they'll react, but I guess it's worth a shot if it means I can have more study time. The idea of planning study blocks sounds good too, but I have to really stick to it.\ntherapist: It sounds like you have a couple of promising strategies to consider. Would you like to set a specific goal for talking to your manager, and maybe think about how you might approach the conversation?\nclient: Yeah, setting a goal sounds smart. Maybe setting a date to talk to them, like by next week, could help me actually do it instead of just thinking about it. I could plan out what to say, like emphasizing how adjusting my schedule could help with my studies.\ntherapist: Having a clear goal like setting a date to talk by next week sounds like a great plan. How about we also discuss some potential ways to bring up your schedule adjustment in the conversation with your manager?\nclient: client: Sure, that sounds helpful. I think maybe I could start by explaining my situation with school and how important my studies are. Then, I could suggest adjusting my hours to focus more on weekends or just ask if there are any options that might work better for both of us.\ntherapist: That sounds like a solid plan. You’ve set a clear goal to talk to your manager by next week, focusing on emphasizing the importance of your studies and suggesting potential schedule adjustments. Remember to stay open to their suggestions as well. Alongside, sticking to the study blocks will help you manage your time effectively. Keep your goals in mind, and know that it’s okay to ask for the support you need to succeed. Reach out if you need any more support or want to talk through your approach before your meeting. You're taking important steps, and you've got this!\nclient: Thanks, I'll definitely keep that in mind. I appreciate the support and might check in if I feel stuck.","completed":true}
{"id":"znn21k","timestamp":1671148800000,"category":"school_life","concern":" A blurb on my situation and why I’m asking this: I’m currently in my school’s business program (includes majors in finance, economics, info sys, marketing, etc) with the aim of graduating with a bachelors in management information systems, however calculus has been a major roadblock for me.   \nI barely passed precalculus at a cc the first time I took it, failed calculus at the cc, then had to retake precalculus due to credit issues when transferring but failed it this time, and now I’ll need to take calculus again at a cc, and I have little hope that I’ll pass. I have a deadline to pass that class this next semester and if I don’t I’ll be kicked from the business program and won’t have access to any of the above listed majors. Already the prospects of having a nice info sys job are starting to dim. The only major I can think of that will allow me to not take calculus and graduate in a reasonable time is interdisciplinary studies. My remaining classes until I graduate would be poli sci because why not, I think it’s an interesting subject and there’d be no point to taking my remaining business or finance or information systems classes if I can’t have that major at the end of it.  \n\n\n..  \n\n\nTl;dr I suck at calculus  \n\n\nSo basically what my two questions are: will I be stuck working minimum wage jobs with the degree in the title or is there some hope for a “normal” working-in-an-office job?  \nWhat are some jobs that are open to both business and political science majors (because I’m assuming that’s where I’d most likely be heading with this plan)?","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello!

It's great to have you here today. Whenever you're ready, feel free to share what's on your mind or any concerns you might have.\nclient: Hey, thanks for having me. I'm feeling really anxious about this math placement test I have to take soon. I've been doing well in my math classes, but I'm worried I might mess up and end up in a class that's way below my level.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're feeling anxious because there's a lot riding on this test, and you're worried it might not reflect your true abilities. What has your experience been like with math in the past?\nclient: I've always done well in my math classes, usually getting A's, but tests like these make me nervous because they cover material that I might not have used in a while. It's just kind of frustrating to think that all my hard work could be overlooked if I don't perform well on this one test.\ntherapist: It seems like you're feeling frustrated because this test seems to carry so much weight, and it doesn't fully capture all the effort and success you've had in your math classes. What do you think might help ease some of that anxiety or frustration you're experiencing?\nclient: I guess brushing up on some of the older material could help, but honestly, just knowing that this one test isn't the end-all-be-all would probably make a difference. It'd be nice to feel like my past achievements still count for something, you know?\ntherapist: It's understandable to want your past successes to be acknowledged. How might it feel to focus on your achievements and strengths as you prepare?\nclient: client: It might help a bit, yeah. Reminding myself of what I've achieved could boost my confidence. But it's tough to shake off the worry completely, you know?\ntherapist: It makes sense that it's hard to let go of that worry entirely. How do you think acknowledging your past successes might influence your confidence as you approach the test?\nclient: I think it could give me a bit of a confidence boost, reminding me that I have a solid foundation in math. It might not eliminate all my nerves, but it could help me feel more prepared and capable going in.\ntherapist: That's a great insight. How might using that confidence boost influence the way you approach your study sessions or test day?\nclient: client: I guess it could help me be more focused and less panicky while studying. On test day, maybe I’d feel a bit calmer knowing that I’ve handled tough math before and can do it again.\ntherapist: It sounds like building on that foundation could really help you feel more grounded. How do you imagine your study sessions or test day might look different if you approached them with that increased calmness?\nclient: Well, I think my study sessions might be less chaotic—like I'd have a clearer plan and wouldn't feel overwhelmed by everything I need to review. On test day, maybe I’d be able to pace myself better and not freeze up if I don't immediately know an answer.\ntherapist: It sounds like having a clear plan could make a big difference for you. Would you like to explore creating a structured study schedule or strategies for managing test-day nerves?\nclient: Yeah, I think that could really help. Having a structured plan might make everything feel a bit less daunting, and any tips for keeping calm on test day would definitely be useful.\ntherapist: Based on what you said, we could look at crafting a study schedule with designated review times and breaks, and also explore relaxation techniques for test day like deep breathing or visualization. Which would you like to start with?\nclient: I think starting with a study schedule would be great. Having something planned out might help me feel more in control of what I need to do.\ntherapist: Creating a study schedule sounds like a solid first step. We can decide on how many days a week you'd like to study, what subjects to focus on, and when to take breaks. How does that sound for an action plan?\nclient: client: That sounds perfect, honestly.
