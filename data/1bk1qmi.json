  "concern": "Hey guys, I am an accounting and finance double major, and I may have failed an accounting class that is only offered in the winter term (we use the quarter system).  This class is a prerequisite to every other upper-level accounting course.  Accounting majors need 225 quarter credits to be CPA eligible, making it a 5-year degree for a full-time student.  Failing this class will set me back an entire year, and I won't be able to make any progress toward my degree while I am waiting for the class to be available again a year from now.  Once I do retake the class and hopefully pass, there is a whole year's worth of classes after, which is the \"5th-year senior series\".  The other problem with staying an extra year is I can't financially support it.  I took out student loans, which will run out, and I can't afford to take out more.  \n\nI took 18 credits and had five finals during this finals week, something I thought I could handle.  It was my 4th final of the week and 2nd of the day; I didn't spend much time studying for it because I had been doing really well in the class and had borderline grades in my other classes, which I prioritized.  I had a B going into the final exam, but the midterm and final make up 85% of the class grade, so failing it tanked my grade to a C-, which is not passing.   \n\nI am contemplating changing my major to just finance due to having to wait a whole year to retake the class.  I would be able to graduate in the upcoming fall as I am just a couple of classes short of the finance degree requirement.  This is a tough decision because I have an internship lined up at a Big 4 accounting firm, and I don't want to lose that.  I also enjoy accounting and have done well in past accounting classes, it is something that I want as a career.  \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation, or have any suggestions of other possible options?
