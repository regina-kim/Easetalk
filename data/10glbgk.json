  "concern": "I’m taking all online classes and I have to take a natural science class and it’s lab, which is typically taken together at the same time and with the same professor if they are available. So I have the same professor for both the Biology and its lab extension. For our first week’s assignment, the teacher gave us a list of 8 questions we had to answer about ourselves in a paragraph form of at least 200 words. I wrote my paragraph and posted it then checked the lab and she asked the same 8 questions and I didn’t really think much of it when I posted my same introduction to the lab class also since all my answers to these questions are the same no matter what. Well she graded one class and said “Submitting the same work in different classes is considered plagiarism, and is a serious academic offense.” \nSo I understand how “using the same work” could be considered plagiarism, but in an instance like this one where it’s just meant to be an introduction to get to know your classmates and for attendance verification purposes, is it really a serious academic offense or considered plagiarism if it’s my own writing and about me? It’s not like it was a 10 page paper or a normal homework assignment. \nI supposed it could be considered lazy to not reword it, but it could also be considered pretty lazy for the professor to use the same exact questions for the lab class as the other class if they are meant to be taken simultaneously.",
