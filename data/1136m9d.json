Let's try to break this down a bit further. On a scale of 110, how anxious do you feel about this decision right now?\nclient: On a scale of 110, I'd say my anxiety about this decision is around an 8 right now. This level of anxiety reflects my ongoing concern that committing to a major might limit my ability to adapt to changing interests over time.\ntherapist: Given your anxiety is an 8, what small, manageable step can you take this week to explore your interests further? Could you research one interdisciplinary major, attend a career counseling session, or reach out to an alumnus for their perspective?\nclient: I could attend a career counseling session this week to gain more insights into flexible options and how others have navigated similar uncertainties. Even as I take this step, I'm still anxious that it might not completely safeguard against feeling locked into a path if my interests evolve over time.\ntherapist: That's a great step forward, and it's important to remember that uncertainty is a natural part of life. Even as you explore your options and gather more information, there will always be some degree of uncertainty. But by taking small steps and staying open to new possibilities, you'll be better equipped to navigate whatever the future holds.\nclient: I appreciate your encouragement about embracing uncertainty and taking small steps, as it helps me feel more prepared for the future. Even so, I'm still anxious that committing to a major might restrict my ability to adapt if my interests evolve unexpectedly.",
