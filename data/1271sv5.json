  "concern": "Ok, I am very confused and frustrated, and I don't know what to do here.\n\nSo, I am in a very interdisciplinary major (won't say what because it's a VERY small department and it will immediately doxx myself and this person) and we have an approved course list that comes out every semester that tells us what those courses \"count\" for in the major. There are some staples that never change and what requirements they fulfill, but the real reason this list is sent out is so we know how more niche classes (say, ones that are only offered in Fall or Spring, or only offered in even years, etc.) can be used to meet our major requirements. \n\nFor years, the list archives show CLASS 101 as fulfilling X, Y, and Z requirements. Now, I know the curriculum hasn't changed because I know the person teaching the class. Yes, it is the same professor. It is one of the \"staples\" I mentioned above. It's offered every semester, and the core requirements do not change. Now it's listed as only fulfilling X requirement for the major. The class, again, has not changed in any way. I have even confirmed with the prof that, outside of writing new test questions to make sure nobody cheats, the content covered will remain identical and they have no idea why it might suddenly be different. \n\nThis is also now true for CLASS 102, CLASS 103, CLASS 104, etc. In previous semesters, they have been consistently used to fulfill A, B, and C. Now they only fulfill A. \n\nWhat this means, essentially, is that I am going to have to stay another YEAR (I was supposed to graduate in Fall) to complete more classes to fulfill requirements that the classes I ALREADY TOOK should have covered, because now, suddenly, they don't fulfill those requirements anymore. Literally just because this one person said so. Or, worst case scenario, I will max out my units (I'm a senior and was a transfer so I'm already close to doing that) and not be allowed to finish at all since my uni won't let anyone enroll in Fall or Spring if they have over 132 units. All because my adviser has changed the requirements. \n\nI've tried to email the adviser about this change, and they said it should have always been listed this way and I'll just have to take these other classes to make up for the changes. Except, like, we went over a course plan together. TWICE. And these classes fulfilled those requirements *then*. It feels like this person just randomly pulled these new rules out of thin air at the last minute, and it's gonna tank me. \n\nI am one of only maybe 10 students in my sub-specialty, so this isn't something that screws over the *whole* department. But, like... I am still fully at risk of not getting a degree now because my adviser has shifted the goalposts at the last minute. It's been established for YEARS that these classes fulfill these distribution requirements for the major, and now suddenly I'm expected to just accept that a bunch of my credits won't count toward my degree anymore??? Also, what is stopping this major adviser from pulling this nonsense again if I do stay an extra year and they decide I can't be on the degree list because they've changed the requirements yet again??? \n\nWho can I talk to about this? I am (obviously) livid and I have the receipts. Unless my adviser can produce a darn good reason to suddenly change the major requirements with NO WARNING, or why these classes can't count for students who have already taken them, I feel like this is worth going higher up. I just don't know who \"higher up\" is. The department chair? The dean of the college? \n\nThanks.",
