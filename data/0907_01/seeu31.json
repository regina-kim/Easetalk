  "concern": "I'm in a MA program right now and we just started in-person learning. Until this week, I had been at my parents' house doing online school from there. While I'm definitely not the biggest proponent of online school, I was actually really enjoying life at home. I got to focus on doing readings and work without worrying about maintaining my own living space, I didn't have a commute to and from classes, and I really enjoyed hanging out with my family every day. Now I'm in a different city which is still pretty shut down from the pandemic, living alone, I can't see anyone, I haven't been able to focus on my coursework that much, and I just feel really *lonely* especially since the people in my cohort aren't keen on getting together due to the pandemic. Even though I absolutely love my program and what I'm studying, I'm starting to question if it's worth the lifestyle choices that are necessary (e.g., moving away from home, the job search being global rather than local). Now, I'm finding myself wishing the weeks would pass until I can go back during the break. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way and how they cope with it. I'm also wondering if moving away for grad school is that much better if there weren't a pandemic shutting everything down/limiting any social activities; especially since so many people refer to grad school as an isolating experience anyway.",
