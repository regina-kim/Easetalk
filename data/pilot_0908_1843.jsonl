Until this week, I had been at my parents' house doing online school from there. While I'm definitely not the biggest proponent of online school, I was actually really enjoying life at home. I got to focus on doing readings and work without worrying about maintaining my own living space, I didn't have a commute to and from classes, and I really enjoyed hanging out with my family every day. Now I'm in a different city which is still pretty shut down from the pandemic, living alone, I can't see anyone, I haven't been able to focus on my coursework that much, and I just feel really *lonely* especially since the people in my cohort aren't keen on getting together due to the pandemic. Even though I absolutely love my program and what I'm studying, I'm starting to question if it's worth the lifestyle choices that are necessary (e.g., moving away from home, the job search being global rather than local). Now, I'm finding myself wishing the weeks would pass until I can go back during the break. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way and how they cope with it. I'm also wondering if moving away for grad school is that much better if there weren't a pandemic shutting everything down\/limiting any social activities; especially since so many people refer to grad school as an isolating experience anyway.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome!

{"id":"119bwqj","timestamp":1677024000000,"category":"school_life","concern":"I graduated college less than a year ago (May 2022); and my undergraduate experience was already screwed up by COVID-19 - I was forced to skip out on a full year before returning to Senior year because the US did not allow international students to take hybrid classes and my university was not offering at least 3 in-person classes for me during the 2020 - 2021 lockdown. So I got to watch all my friends graduate without me; I did qualify for an accelerated Master's Program in Economics and I was accepted but I opted not to pursue it due to COVID-19 and feeling that I did not want to stay in Fordham for both undergraduate and graduate school.  \n\n\nAnyway, I somehow managed to get a short-term contract at the World Bank since they hired people from around the world, and if I work for the World Bank in a full-time job for about 15 years I am eligible for permanent residency (green card). For all intents and purposes I really want to stay and live and build a life in the US (especially now with geopolitical events in SE Asia). The problem is that I don't have options for employment in the private sector because the H1-b process is absurdly random and difficult; and the World Bank and IMF have outright told me that I can't get a fulltime job without AT LEAST a Master's Degree (it's already brutally difficult for me to get even a short-term contract role, let alone a fulltime job); and even this employment is not guaranteed.  \n\n\nI'm thinking of getting a Master's Degree in Statistics or Data Science (an MBA or Master's degree in economics isn't very helpful) but I have checked that I did not take enough undergrad courses in Math or Computer Science to qualify (at least in the US). I'm fairly certain that my math skills and coding skills are nowhere near good enough for grad school (I struggled for a 3.60 gpa even before COVID-19)  \nI'm honestly totally lost because I'm being forced to prepare for grad school so soon, just after I managed to find something solid career-wise (I'm 23 turning 24). Otherwise I have to go back to the Philippines and I probably won't have an opportunity to immigrate elsewhere anymore.  \n\n\nAny advice for my circumstances?","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome!

How do you think your life might change if you were able to achieve that sense of security and independence here in the US?\nclient: I think I'd feel a lot more at ease and less anxious about the future. I could focus on building personal relationships and enjoying life more without constantly stressing over my immigration status or career uncertainties.\ntherapist: Therapist: It sounds like achieving that stability could open up a lot of opportunities for you to enjoy life more fully. What steps do you think might bring you closer to feeling more at ease and securing that future you envision?\nclient: client: Well, I think going back to school for a Master's might be necessary, even if it's a bit daunting right now. I guess I also need to improve my skills and maybe look for other opportunities where I can stand out and secure a more stable position.\ntherapist: Based on what you've shared, pursuing further education and enhancing your skills could be key steps towards achieving the stability and career satisfaction you're aiming for. Possible options might include researching Master's programs that align with your interests or exploring skill-building workshops in data science. What do you think would be the most feasible first step for you right now?\nclient: Honestly, I think the first step might be to look into some online courses or workshops to get a better grasp of the skills I need. That could help me feel more confident about applying for a Master's program.\ntherapist: Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach to strengthening your skills and building your confidence for a Master's program. What specific online courses or workshops do you have in mind, or would you like to explore some options together? We could identify some potential barriers and plan ways to overcome them, too.\nclient: client: I haven't really pinpointed any specific courses yet, but I've heard good things about Coursera and edX. Maybe we could go over some options together? It might help to talk through any challenges I might face along the way.\ntherapist: Therapist: Exploring Coursera and edX together sounds like a great plan. We can look at courses that match your career goals and skill needs. What are some challenges you anticipate, and how can we plan to address them?\nclient: client: I think one of the big challenges would be balancing time between work and taking courses. Also, the fear of not being good enough for the program is still on my mind. Maybe having a strategy for time management and dealing with self-doubt would help.\ntherapist: Therapist: You've identified some very insightful areas to address, like time management and self-doubt. Let's focus on breaking down your schedule to find small, manageable chunks of time for your courses, which can make a big difference. To tackle self-doubt, we can explore affirmations and perhaps set up regular check-ins to monitor your progress and celebrate the wins, big and small. Remember, taking this first step towards online learning is already a positive move forward. How about we follow up with a list of potential courses and a basic schedule for you to start with? You're making some great strides towards your goals, and I'm here to support you each step of the way.\nclient: That sounds like a solid plan. I think having a basic schedule and some affirmations could really help me stay on track and feel better about myself.\ntherapist: Great to hear that a basic schedule and affirmations feel like helpful tools for you. Your determination to pursue this path is truly inspiring. Let's get started by putting together a list of potential courses and draft a simple schedule that aligns with your current commitments.
