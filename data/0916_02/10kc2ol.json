  "concern": "title: How To Manage My Classes?\nHello, I’m currently taking 2 online classes while I work full time at a community college. I’m excited that I’m going to college but it’s getting really hard to the point that I’m falling behind in both classes. I have an F and a D in both classes (Art and Math). I’m afraid that even if I pass these classes, I would have to cram all my work. Like I don’t want to my foundational thinking to be screwed or messed up in my future college classes.\n\nI plan to transfer to a 4 year, the music class is a class necessary for the transfer while the math is not, but it is a prerequisite to the class that will transfer so I’m more worried about that. Should I drop the music class? Or am I just being overwhelmed by the such limited time I have to do assignments? I’m also assuming that since both classes are online, theres more of a workload since my professors are giving me everything all at once? I’m in my early 20’s and I’m having to do a bit of extra time and effort to make up what I’ve lost especially in my math class.\n\nMy goal is to pass with A’s but I feel that in order to do so, I would need to cram all the work in and not actually “learn” or “retain” the information for future classes. Has anyone had a rough start to college even if it’s online?",
