  "concern": "title: Anyone else struggle with lab techniques?\nHey, Neuroscience Ph.D. candidate here. I work in a systems neuroscience lab. Therefore, one of the things you probably guess that we do are surgeries, except I could never learn how to do them. In short, the post-doc who taught me was not a very good teacher and the lab environment has not been the best for learning. I was taking so long to learn them that my PI basically said that the staff research scientist would do all my surgeries while I focused on building other skills. This has been probably one of the single biggest blows to my confidence as a researcher. A skill that I was sure I could learn. Everyone else in my cohort was able to learn them but me, and I cannot get over this. I hate being the only one who seems to not be able to do a very core thing in systems neuroscience. \n\nAny advice is welcome. I am trying my best to look past this, but it's hard. I am not particularly good at anything else. So, I am not bringing some other core skill to the lab that makes up for this deficiency.",
