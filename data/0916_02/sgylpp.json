  "concern": "title: Stressing out over inconsistent grading\nI did really well as an undergrad. If I put the effort in and listened to feedback, I'd get a good grade. If I tried to wing it, I'd get a bad grade. I got a top mark on my dissertation that year and felt good going into my masters.\n\nI'm at a new uni this year and my grades are always either very high or very low. I was just given feedback on a presentation I did, and one of the comments left for me was that I should be more thoughtful as a grad student, with no further context. I was also marked down for following the outline provided to us and not adding additional slides, which we weren't asked to do. This was one of 3 assignments we were given over Christmas, during which time staff were on leave and not answering emails. I'm losing respect for my instructors, and I am kind of dreading beginning my dissertation. This presentation was a proposal for my dissertation, and based on the grading, my advisor and the instructor who grades the papers are not on the same page.\n\nI don't know if I'm just being a baby over this, but I feel like I can't anticipate what my instructors are looking for and I'm worried about my dissertation. I have a few friends in the class who are getting similar marks and I know they're putting huge efforts into their assignments. At this point, I just want to pass and get my degree.",
