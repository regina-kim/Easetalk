I lived on campus so I went out a bunch and made new friends and passed all my classes. But I'm back home and home is where I'm lonely af because I don't have many friends here and I can't drive so I can't go out anywhere by myself. \n\nThe good thing is that one of the friends I made only lives 10 minutes away and we're planning on hanging out every so often and I'm part of a club that meets to do stuff every Wednesday evening on campus (same friend is also part of it and will drive me there) but still. I'm not sure why I'm feeling depressed and lonely despite this but how do y'all cope with it especially since summer break is so long.",
