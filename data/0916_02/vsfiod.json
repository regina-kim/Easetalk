I do want to go for my masters fall 2023 and was talking to my parents. They recommended I get my masters in geography. They said geography because not only would it open doors in other fields incase I donâ€™t want to be a cop in the future but it can also help with crime analysis because of GIS. My only concern is Iâ€™m not a geography major right now and am scared it would be much more difficult than just getting my masters in CJ too. Do you think they have a good point or am I overthinking the masters in geography and will be fine?",
