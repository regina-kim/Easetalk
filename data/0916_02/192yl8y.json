Your choice to focus on one week at a time shows a practical and positive approach.\n\nAs you move ahead, remember that each small step brings you closer to your bigger picture of post-graduation life. Embrace each little victory along the way. If at any point you need support or feel stuck, I'm here to help you navigate through it.
