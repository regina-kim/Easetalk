  "concern": "title: Quitting my masters?\nThis will require some context but I am interested in people’s opinions. \n\nI was hired for my current job about a year ago. The expectation was I would finish my master’s in August and start my job in October. I did not end up completing my thesis by then, but I kept the same timeline with my job. My company was extremely understanding and left it up to me if i wanted to start full time, part time, or delay my start until I finished my thesis. I started part time in october and after a month have not made any more thesis progress. I really really want to give up on my thesis and just work full time.\n\nThe thesis has always caused an immense amount of stress for me and it only gets worse with time. At this point I have to think that the mental and physical (namely sleep) benefits of quitting my thesis far outweigh the benefits of completing my degree. Is this something I can bring up to my boss or do you think I should stay silent on this?",
