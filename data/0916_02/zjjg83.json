  "concern": "title: help me pick major?\nA bit about me. When I was 18 i took a dishwashing job at a local nursing home. It was my first job. I ended up becoming a cook and have bounced around from cook job to higher paying cook job. It's all ive ever done. Im decent at it. Ive learned and covered alot of kitchen management aspects along the way as well. It's been 10 years now. I dont love it, but it really feels like my only applicable skill.\n\n\nI have dabbled in college courses along the way but i always get swallowed into the fast cash of overtime at a new higher paying job. So ive never truly commited. Now, i feel like its either sht or get off the pot and im not sure what i should truly pursue a degree in.\n\n\nI spend all of my free time making music, its a huge passion and hoby for me that has landed me a few really nice paychecks but betting everything on that would be insane. other than that i spend my time reading self help books and learning different aspects of finance.  \n\n\nMy gf has asked me to join her in the medical field but it doesnt peak any interest. My buddy has always told me i'd be great at what he does in the behavioral health field and that does sound super interesting and purposeful to me but i havent done enough of it to know.\n\n\nI feel like im looking for something that could umbrella a career and all of my interests. Like, maybe a degree that would require me to learn skills that can be applied to music and personal finance like some type of management or accounting thing. Even then, ive never really met an accountant that made enough money to just be an accountant. \n\n\nDoes anyone have any pointers?",
