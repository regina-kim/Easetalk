  "concern": "title: Major Advice\nI thought this was a good place to ask for advice on this topic, so here we go. I'm headed into my second year of college at a state school in PA. I am currently in their english department and planned on going into education. I have since changed my mind and I am thinking of going into Pharmacy. However, the school won't let me do the pre-pharmacy program because it was \"Designed for freshman\". The Pre-Pharmacy program is accelerated and takes a few years off your degree. I told them I was only really interested in pre-pharmacy and they said the best they could do was switch me to chemistry and then I could apply to pharmacy school and hope to get in. Should I keep trying? Am I wrong to think I should be allowed into the program since I've been a student for two years?",
