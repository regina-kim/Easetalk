Iâ€™m thinking maybe itâ€™s too late to switch programs, and I can just study International Relations (or maybe Social Work) for my Masters. \n\nBut Iâ€™m not sure if my undergraduate degree will be qualified for that kind of masters, since it is two very different fields. May I ask if your undergraduate degree matters when educational institutions look at your application for a Masterâ€™s Degree?",
