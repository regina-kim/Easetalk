  "concern": "title: On academic dismissal\nI (F20) just got on academic dismissal from my uni. I tried to hard but it wasn’t good enough. My uni told me to do 1 semester at community (need to get 2.4 &amp; 12 units) and I can come back in the spring. It made me feel super bad about myself like I’m not good enough. I’m on the pre dental track so I’ve been struggling with the science classes but I’m determined to do better! My cumulative gpa is 3.1 but my gpa from my uni is 1.87 ( I’m a transfer). How can I feel better? Is this common?",
