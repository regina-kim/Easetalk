  "concern": "title: Major that incorporates Math with Communications?\nI'm going to be a Senior in HS next year, and with College Apps starting up within the next few months I've been trying to think about what I want to major in but I'm having a really hard time doing so. I understand that I don't have to get it right on the first try, and that most people don't get it right on the first try, but I'm still at a crossroads. On one hand I'm very naturally gifted in the Math and Sciences, so a career in STEM would seem ideal. The only thing is I don't want to spend the rest of my life in just STEM, I really enjoy stuff in the humanities as well such as public speaking. If there were a way to incorporate STEM, something I have a natural gift for, with humanities such as public speaking/communications, something that I enjoy, I'd be set\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr I could major in STEM and minor in the humanities?",
