Preparing a few questions or comments about the lab sounds like a practical approach, and it might ease the pressure you feel. Pushing through the initial awkwardness is often the key to more natural interactions. \n\nAs you work on this, remember to be patient with yourself and acknowledge each small success. You've set an achievable goal, and your willingness to step out of your comfort zone is truly commendable. As your next step, perhaps reflecting on those interactions weekly could help you notice patterns and progress. If you ever feel the need for more support or just a space to reflect, I'm here to help you along the way. Keep up the great work—you're moving in a positive direction!",

  "concern": "title: How do I make friends in a commuter university?\nI know I'm not the first person to ask this nor will I be the last, but I need advice. To be brief, I didn't really make new friends in my first two semesters of college (in-person) nor in my third semester (all online). I'm finally going back after a semester of taking classes at home, but only once a week for lab. I don't have time to join a club or go to school events, so that's not an option for making new friends. I don't plan on joining a fraternity nor do I intend on going to parties. I live somewhat far from campus, the city is big, and I don't drive nor do I want to spend money on Uber rides, so making plans (if I actually make new friends) would be hard. Basically, I want to see if I can make new friends in my lab class or whenever I get lunch, but I'm just socially awkward. It's not the same as making friends in K-12.",
