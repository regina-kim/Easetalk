  "concern": "title: My closest friends repeatedly abandon me on our nights out to go the bars and I’m under 21\nHi there! My closest friends are all one year older than me and are now seniors and over 21 while I am 20 F and my birthday is at the end of the school year. They are my going-out group and I love them, we always went out to parties and had fun (and we also have close and genuine friendships outside of that). Problem is, ever since they all turned 21 they often abandon me at the end of a night out to go to the bars which I can’t go to (college town and they check thoroughly). I end up being left to go home alone which makes me feel so abandoned and lonely. I feel like my friends don’t actually care about my well being and only care to have me around when it’s easy. I totally get going out to the bars and I don’t want them to stop but it’s the making plans with me and then excluding me halfway through the night that I find hurtful. I finally opened up about this today and they expressed a desire to change and promised that tonight will most definitely be different. It wasn’t. I feel betrayed. Am I wrong to expect them to take my feelings into account when they make plans with me? Is there anything I should be doing different? I’m currently feeling very alienated from this group and trying to find new friends.",
