This way, you maintain your assertiveness without escalating the situation. \n\nIt's empowering to see how you're planning to take these steps to protect your personal space and peace of mind. Remember, these skills take time, and it's okay to refine your approach as you go. As a next step, maybe try drafting out those key points and practice them aloud.

  "concern": "title: PSA: “do not disturb” means DO NOT DISTURB (this is a post about respect)\nLiving in a dorm is hell as it is. I can’t tell you how many times people have disrespected the “do not disturb” sign. \n\nIf somebody has that kind of sign, kindly DO NOT DO IT AND WALK AWAY. They don’t want to talk to you or anybody else. Even if you’re an RA, just email or text. Why? Because I’m sleeping. Or I’m taking a test. Or I’m doing homework. And I need to concentrate.\n\nAnd you… you decide to be the snide mufker who knocks on my door with the “do not disturb” sign. The “you” I’m referring to is the guy who hosts dorm parties every Tuesday night, and knocks on my door to ask if I was the one who called the cop. Comes to ask me random questions at 3am. Or another one, my neighbors who are curious about something.\n\n*Does no mean no?* Then why does “do not disturb” not mean *do not disturb?*\n\nIf you do this and you live in a dorm, please, kindly go live off campus. Or just drop out of college all together. Because if you do not respect other people’s boundaries, you’re not gonna go far in life and you might as well give up now.",
