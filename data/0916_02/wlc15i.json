  "concern": "title: Should I move during my gap year before PA school? Difficult situation, more in post\nI (21m) am applying to PA school in ‘24 after taking a gap year next year, and I graduate a semester early and will start working as a CNA in January. I went to school in my college hometown (about 120k ppl) and somewhat regret it now.\n\nHowever, I was forced out of the closet to my parents last year around this time (you can see my post history). I have so many memories associated with this town, and while the city is queer friendly, dating is difficult. It feels kind of constraining to consistently live here because of past memories blended with how dating is difficult here. Even with a romantic partner, I fear PDA within the town’s radius because of my family, and I feel like I can never express my queerness fully without wondering if I’ll run into someone I can’t be out to. There also aren’t many queer events I can meet people at here.\n\nI’m largely self-sufficient by living with roommates and paying for my living expenses, and I have a fund of about $5/$6k saved up. I also have a well-paying part time job during school, and I’ll start full-time work until my lease ends in August for sure. However, if I move to a semi nearby metropolis, I would be applying to schools not only in this large city but also other large cities around the US and would have to move again. \n\nIt kind of just feels constraining no matter how hard I try. I have a fantastic support system, many meaningful connections in my life, a great therapist, and great housemates. But these strong feelings I have with this city and my family around the area always just puts me on the edge. Should I wait another 3 years to move for grad school (sometime 2025) or move next year with the potential to remain in the big city I would move to for grad school?",
