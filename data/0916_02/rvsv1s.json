  "concern": "title: Submitting a barely started assignment\nSoo , I’m in second year of university studying English Language and Linguistics .. since I started second year I’ve been thinking that my course is just so useless and have had no motivation to do the work so I have just been starting them the day before and submitting barely finished work. For my first one I got 58% (for one module) then I got 68% (for another module) .. I still have one more assignment for each module (so two left)\n\nHowever for another module I had two assignments literally wrote like 500 words out of 2000 for each and just submitted it … I’ll probably get like 20% on them both .. I’ve realised after this, I might as well just start putting in effort again .. if I do well in my other courses , do you guys think I will be able to retake the module that I failed?\n\nThanks",
