  "concern": "title: So I’ve started college but I want a change\nI’m a first year student who’s recently finished summer school and overall I’ve enjoyed my time at university, but I honestly don’t think it’s for me. That’s not to say that I want to drop out, but I was hoping to get a full time job and take classes online instead. Also, I don’t have a car or any other sort of transportation besides walking or being driven around by a relative’s vehicle, so honestly, I don’t have reliable transportation when I’m at school. This is why I’d rather stay at home. \n\nAnyway, if that doesn’t work, I was thinking about just going back to cc (which was supposed to happen in the first place), but my family is pretty against me doing that and believe that I would be selling myself short by doing so. I’ve also considered dropping out as well because the major that I have chosen doesn’t seem to be a proper choice and it may not help me in the long run (elementary education). I’d rather not waste anyone’s time and money, you know? \n\nThen also there are some things in my personal life that I haven’t shared with my family and I’m unsure that if it ever comes up in conversation or I decide to tell them, then they’ll stop helping me pay for school. That’s why I wanted to get a job just in case something were to happen and they decide not to help anymore. \n\nNot sure what to do anymore :(",
