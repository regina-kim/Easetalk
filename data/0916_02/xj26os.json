  "concern": "title: Tips for potentially going back to college?\nI dropped out in my second year of psychology coz it was quite hard. Looking back I think while yes it was hard I definitely didn’t put in as much effort as I could have. Oops. I’m wanting to potentially go back and try again but I’m worried it will in fact be too hard even if I try really hard this time. I don’t think I could deal with everyone’s disappointment in me for a second time. Should I reapply for next year? Or does anyone have any degree suggestions similar to psych that may not be “as intense”? \nCheers!",
