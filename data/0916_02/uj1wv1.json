I also just have a couple other issues. \n\nIt all really gets in the way of doing good in school, even though I’m on meds and found a therapist, I’m just constantly struggling. \n\nI want to go to med school so bad but I genuinely think I won’t be able to because it’s so hard for me to keep my grades up and do even decent in all my classes.
