  "concern": "title: super burnt out, but i feel guilty about taking the summer off\nhey guys, so i graduate next weekend from my undergrad and as I'm finishing up my finals I'm facing a huge dilemma. This year has been particularly difficult in terms of coursework as I've been writing my thesis, but I've also had a lot going on with my campus job (i work in an office) as someone else quit and left me and one other person with their huge list of responsibilities that has taken up a lot of my time. I feel so miserably burnt out trying to get through the rest of this semester and the idea of applying and interviewing to get a temporary summer job before I start grad school in August sounds like a nightmare. I would love to use this summer as a break before my rigorous grad program that runs all year long for about 3 years, but I also feel guilty about the idea of not having a summer job (I'd get an internship but jfc there are none in my area that will allow anyone who isn't already a grad student in, plus my program will put me into an intership position anyways). My family keeps telling me that they're glad I'll finally have a break but I'm worried about being dead weight, have any of you been in this position before? Am I being overdramatic in one way or another? This might just be the finals stress rotting my brain but I really can't stop worrying about it. Any advice is appreciated :)",
