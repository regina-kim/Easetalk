  "concern": "title: Have you ever made a mistake in your research or discrepancy that completely changes your outlook and thesis?\nI’m basically studying devotional objects from the Medieval ages and how people still interact with them today. My methodology includes looking at blogposts and newspapers of people who interact with these images. Im using first hand accounts. Some of these blog posts discuss a legend associated to a specific object, but there isn’t much discussed further. I can’t find any additional literature on it. \n\nI feel like a fraud and I don’t know how else to deal with it. Nothing is published or written yet, but I feel like im just not doing a good job. No sign from my supervisor either, even though I messaged him. \n\nI feel stupid. I based my idea on an assumption. I have a bunch of academic articles that can back up this assumption though.\n\nI know it sounds super vague but I just feel like shit. How have you gotten over mistakes or discrepancies in your research?",
