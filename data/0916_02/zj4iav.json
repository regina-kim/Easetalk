  "concern": "title: Tell my family now or let them find out I dropped out\nI went to college for a month, then dropped out because I didn't like it at all and I wasn't feeling good in there at all. I decided to pursue an artistic career (not requiring a degree) in parallel of a job. It's what I always wanted to do and I tried to tell them so many times, but they wouldn't understand. So I decided to not ask them this time and I just dropped out. Now it's the end of semester and soon they'll find out, it could even be before christmas, but should I tell them anyways before Christmas though ? I just don't feel like keep lying to them and receive all of my gifts for my \"hard work\" that I didn't even do. The problem is also that they were paying for my rent and helping me financially, so without their help I'm in a complicated situation although I can still find a job easily, since I have some experience.",
