  "concern": "title: Debating About Getting My PhD?\nI am 31 years old and graduated in 2020 with my Master's in Biochem and Molecular Bio. I've been working in the biotech industry for the past couple years. Like now, I also worked for a couple years in industry between my Bachelor's and Master's. However, I realized that in Biology you are very limited in pay, job opportunities, and growth with just a Bachelor's, which justified pursuing my master's. I do like learning and I think getting a PhD will make me a better Biologist overall, but I know I want to return to industry when finished. I also know if I went back to school it would be for cancer research or Epigenetics. However, unlike a masters program,  the 5+ years of school for a PhD vs the 5+ years of real life work experience is making this decision harder. In addition, the low stipends, PI stories (I've heard both good and bad), and when looking for jobs in the past, the experience potential and pay comparisons varies but not as much as I thought. What are your opinions on going back for a PhD? Do you feel like there are no more limitations with your PhD compared to just having a Master's? It would be great to hear both sides of the argument. Thank you!",
