  "concern": "title: Withdrawing from a Course and Feeling like a Failure\nHey guys, so I'm majoring in computer science and this is my first time with coding, which I'm learning about JAVA programming and man it was hard to grasp. I'm doing a lot of tutoring, but I'm always two assignments behind. I still have until November 28 to withdraw, but I'm probably going to withdraw and I just feel like a failure. I go to a community college and my girlfriend goes to a university and majoring in the same thing as me, but her workload and due dates are much more crazier than mines. I know I shouldn't be comparing, but it makes me feel such a failure and a disappointment to myself and to her. How do I get around this feeling and thoughts? This is my second year, but I feel like I will be behind from getting my Associate's and my two certificates, while my girlfriend should be getting hers this year.",
