It’s so maddening that I’ve even allowed it happen, allowed yet another opportunity slip away due to allowing my poor mental health to completely control me. \n\nAnxiety, depression, etc. are all so bad at the moment. I don’t really know the root cause of it. It just came a couple months ago and has completely taken my over since.\n\nWhat should I do? I really feel lost. Can I even recover from this and save my grades for the semester?
