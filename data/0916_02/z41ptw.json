And if any of you have transferred what helped you decide that was the best decision? How do you know if transferring is the best option? Iâ€™m just scared if I transfer I will still be miserable, I also am not sure where to transfer Iâ€™ve looked into osu but Iâ€™m scared itâ€™ll just be the same. I just need help overall haha",
