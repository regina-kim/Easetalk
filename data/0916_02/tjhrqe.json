  "concern": "title: Im unhappy with my college and its location, but is it worth leaving\nI’m currently a 18M freshman at Parsons The New School of Design in NYC as a Communication Design major (graphic design). This has been my dream school since I was 10 years old but unfortunately after being here for almost 2 semesters, I don’t like it. The classes aren’t as engaging/ geared towards my field of study as I hoped they would be. I find myself being forced to take a lot of useless classes when I could be taking more graphic design oriented courses. \nI’m from Connecticut and used to a suburban lifestyle. I enjoy having the option of driving my car places. I thought the New York lifestyle would be something new and exciting for me because it’s something i’ve always dreamed of, however I just don’t seem to fit in. It’s not enjoyable for me and im usually scared anywhere I go after dusk. It’s very hard to make friends here, and having that handicap has made it hard to venture out and enjoy the city. I feel very alone and isolated here. However, New York is an amazing place for opportunities, especially in the art field, and I’m wondering if i’m throwing away my dream/ chances at a good job by moving back to Connecticut to go to an art school there? I don’t know what jobs would be available for me in CT, and i’m worried i’ll fail and not make money if I move back there. Should I find a way to enjoy New York so I can continue going to school here, or should I move to somewhere I’m comfortable? Is New York really worth the job opportunities for graphic design artists?",
