  "concern": "title: Question about \"letters of good standing\"\nSo I spent my senior year of highschool in college, average grades, 3.0 gpa. But for the next 3 semesters, my gpa dropped to 2.5, to .6, to .4 due to severe mental issues. I've since been diagnosed with major depressive and autism, and enrolled in a local community college. \n\n I've brought my gpa up back to 3.0, and am confident my average for this school will go up to 3.5 or higher next semester since I'm medicated now.\n\nBack to the actual question, a public university near me, Berea college in ky, has a few qualities they need for admissions- and the only one I'm missing is a letter of good standing from every institution after HS I've been to. My community college will be fine, I'm even close to the psych professor here- however my first college's average gpa on file is 1.6, with two consecutive terms being much below 2. Should I even bother applying to Berea?",
