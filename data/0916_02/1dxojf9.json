  "concern": "title: I have an upcoming chemical engineering python exam and I am not sure how to prepare for it \nI am retaking the course as it was so difficult. I do the homework, visit office hours, but still have a hard time doing the exam. It’s an intro class for solving differential equations using Python with Spyder. The exams always consists of solving differential equations and the professor providing screenshots of a code and tells you that you need to find what is wrong with it. How do I go by looking at the code and seeing what’s wrong with it effectively? He allows us to bring 1 cheat sheet.  He sometimes gives hints in the exam by partially starting the code and letting you complete it. He also provides a practice exam but it is nowhere near similar to the real one, so I don’t get why he does that. I haven’t done code in a long while and I am very frustrated with this course. This is the only course I have left until I graduate but it seems I may fail again for the second time. ",
