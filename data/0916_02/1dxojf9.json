  "concern": "title: I have an upcoming chemical engineering python exam and I am not sure how to prepare for it \nI am retaking the course as it was so difficult. I do the homework, visit office hours, but still have a hard time doing the exam. Itâ€™s an intro class for solving differential equations using Python with Spyder. The exams always consists of solving differential equations and the professor providing screenshots of a code and tells you that you need to find what is wrong with it. How do I go by looking at the code and seeing whatâ€™s wrong with it effectively? He allows us to bring 1 cheat sheet.  He sometimes gives hints in the exam by partially starting the code and letting you complete it. He also provides a practice exam but it is nowhere near similar to the real one, so I donâ€™t get why he does that. I havenâ€™t done code in a long while and I am very frustrated with this course. This is the only course I have left until I graduate but it seems I may fail again for the second time. ",
