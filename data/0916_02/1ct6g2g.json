Perhaps reminding yourself of the importance of recharging and the value of your relationships could help counteract that guilt. \n\nTake small steps, and celebrate any progress. Each effort towards setting boundaries and nurturing your personal life is a step towards living more aligned with your values. As we wrap up today, think about how you can remind yourself of these goals when things get challenging. You’re on a meaningful path, and I'm here to support you all the way.
