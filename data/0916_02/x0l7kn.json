  "concern": "title: 1.5-year MS MS&amp;E vs 2-year MBA (Stanford)\nHello all, looking for some guidance on a career pivot and would appreciate your opinions. I'm interested in going back to school next year for both networking and career growth. I have 6 years of work experience with a BSc in Engineering Management and currently work at a MANGA company and make a good salary. As mentioned previously the draw for school is in networking but more specifically also gaining additional skills to potentially create my own \"data insights\" company. \n\nI'm looking at two full time programs from Stanford - the MS Management Science &amp; Engineering (MS&amp;E) and the MBA. I was also looking into the MSCS program but fear it might be too technical and not provide enough of the financial and managerial science needed to build a for-profit company from the ground up. While taking 2 years away from work would a massive loss in earning potential, I've read the Stanford MBA completely overshadows the MS in MS&amp;E in terms of prestige (goes a long way for career opportunities and negotiations at the C-level). On the other hand, the 1.5 year MS MS&amp;E program is very flexible in terms of direction in the degree and would provide more technical courses which could come handy in the eventual creation of a data-focused company. \n\nAny graduates from these programs or people who've hired them present here and willing to chime in? Any and all thoughts/opinions are welcome!",
