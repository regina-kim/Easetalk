Additionally, having a visual reminder of your progress, like checking off completed tasks, might provide a sense of accomplishment and keep you motivated.\n\nRemember, it's okay to adjust your plan as needed and give yourself grace as you find what works best for you. Taking these steps shows a lot of strength and willingness to improve your situation. As your next step, consider designing your weekly schedule and noticing how it feels in practice. Know that each small win is a step towards greater confidence and balance.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you need to discuss how the plan is working for you or explore additional strategies. You're making thoughtful decisions, and it's inspiring to see your dedication to finding balance.",

I'm a Freshman engineering student just for context. \n\nI work hard and put so much time for college which may seem perfect. However, I'm always late in classes and midterms come while there is a ton I still have to study. Its exhausting because I dont get time to have fun and spend with my family. What's making me tired is what I achieve compared to the time and effort I put. \n\nI want to enjoy college and life and have the opportunity to finally understand what I'm learning not only for tests. Now that midterms are over, I'm looking for a new approach for college so I dont repeat the loop all over again.\n\nI'm very excited to hear your tips and thoughts.\n\nThings to put in consideration is that I'm a commuter. Commute to and back from college take about 2.5~3 hours daily + making me tired. Note, next year's commute is gonna be way shorter due to change of campus.",
