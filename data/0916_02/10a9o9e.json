  "concern": "title: I feel like I screwed myself over freshman year and now I’m panicking.\n\nSo going into college I was dead set on majoring in political science. I liked it in college, I want to go into law, it seemed natural. But the more I researched and took classes I didn’t feel like it was worth it. There didn’t seem to be a lot of job security with higher pay like I was looking for, and so I wanted to switch. I really enjoyed my geology classes and it seemed like that was the route to take. But I have always wanted to double major and never even considered just majoring in one thing. So I was going to do polisci and geology.\n\n\nBut still, even after last semester, polisci just didn’t give me good feelings. I took a business class and I loved it. It was difficult but I felt like it was a fun kind of difficult that I felt proud of myself for figuring out over time. I then started thinking, would it be bad if I majored in geology and something business related? I was also looking into computer science as I love computers and such but might be going in over my head. I feel like it’s late in the game and I’m planning on transferring so I don’t want to have to restart as a freshman. \n\n\n\nIs it too late to do this? My biggest concern is transferring, as I really don’t know if switching now would be an option. I’m a sophomore planning on transferring in the fall, but this is making me sick to my stomach.",
