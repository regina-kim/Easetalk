I’m a freshman and it’s already been so hard for me to move away from home even tho I’m only 3 hours away. Regardless, the whole roommate experience I’m still adjusting to. My 3 flatmates are super sweet for the most part and are friendly but whenever I’m in my room and they are talking in the common area I always feel like I need to be there too. Even if it’s just a simple convo between them or if they r leaving, I feel like I have to be there too otherwise they will “hate me.” I know that’s not true at all and no one would care that much but idk why I feel like that. I’m a big people pleaser and I am constantly feeling like everyone hates me and overthink my whole life but this drives me nuts. I feel like I can’t even be in my apartment because I constantly get distracted in the sense that I always need to be in the common area when my other flatmates are there. Can someone help with this? Idk what to do or if I should go see a therapist or something. What’s funny is whenever I’m back home my parents can be gone the whole day but I still don’t feel like this. I only feel like this when I come back to school and I’m in my apartment but I’m so paranoid at this point. Any advice is helpful please!",
