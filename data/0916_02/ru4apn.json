  "concern": "title: Advice on maybe switching out of design major?\nTo keep it as brief as possible, I’m currently double majoring in fashion design and environmental sciences. I’m heading into second semester junior year. I’ve been seriously considering switching out of my design major for something else (maybe comp sci? I’m a math nerd and have picked up some coding previously).\n\nI’ve never felt so stuck on a decision before honestly. I love fashion to death, but I feel like I have too many reasons to leave and my passion is dwindling bc of college. My program isn’t teaching me the skills or getting me the connections I want/need, I feel like it’s ruining my college experience (extremely long labs, working almost constantly, and struggling to keep a social life on top of a job), and I have over a years worth of credits left in the major (~36) and most majors are 30-45 total anyways. My dream with fashion is to have some level of creative freedom or even start my own small brand/social media presence one day. I don’t even need a degree to do this, so maybe my time/money would be better spent on other things.\n\nDoes anyone have experience switching in/out (or not) of art/design? Am I being a baby and I should just finish the major? Any advice or experiences would be appreciated!\n\nTLDR; I love fashion but am frustrated with the degree, thinking about keeping it as a hobby/side hustle and switching into another major",
