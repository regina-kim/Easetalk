  "concern": "title: I hate it when professors say something is \"easy\"\nLiterally the quickest way to make a student feel bad about themselves because they don't quite understand or it's not actually \"easy\" for them.\n\nI was told recently during office hours for a CS class that the file and code I wrote was not needed and that I was doing it wrong and all I had to do was this and that and whatever and she ended by saying \"It's easy.\" \n\nThat made me feel like shit cause I didn't know how to do it despite it being \"easy\" and I was in a depressing mood for the rest of the day and the following day as well. \n\nSaying that an assignment is easy is just unnecessary. You have no idea what someone's struggles are, with the content/class **and** outside of that as well. While an assignment could technically be easy, that doesn't mean it's easy for someone to get up and sit down to do the assignment if they're struggling with their mental health, family issues etc.",
