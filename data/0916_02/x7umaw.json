  "concern": "title: Should I Quit My Part Time Job to Do School Full-time?\nFor context, I’m in the education program with and in five courses (full time). I work in a dining venue that requires working till pretty late at night most times. It’s been a while since i’ve been considering quitting cause I do not enjoy being there (but do like the friends i have there). \nThe last time I worked part time (three shifts) and did school full time, it was really bad for my mental health and I had to drop a course the next semester. \nLuckily my parents (bless their souls) saved up for my education so I don’t have to worry about student loans or paying for school. I also have around 13K in the bank and i’m not a huge spender besides gas money and my phone bill. Money is nice to have n’ all but i’m debating quitting and working during the summer/finding a job related to my degree so I can have more time to study, have free time and hang out with my boyfriend. \n\nShould I still work and risk the having to balance full time school so I can have some money, or should I quit and focus on university full time? \n\nTL;DR: Debating quitting part time job cause I am in university full-time. Conflicted between having more money or being able to focus on studying/having free time.",
