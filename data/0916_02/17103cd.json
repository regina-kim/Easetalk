I have no social life (literally only one friend who lives on the other side of the state and even then we haven't hung out in almost 2 years). I feel like my brain is full, kinda like brain fog, so I cannot focus on what I need to be focusing on. I have no energy. It doesn't matter how much I sleep, I never feel alright. I have no motivation to keep on going because of all of this. I want to do good, and I know I can do good, but I feel so weighed down in my mind that I can't. \n\nHow can I remedy this? How can I get a clearer mind and feel better so that I can do better?",
