I have no intention of making my work my life. I intend to go into industry after finishing. A PhD was what I thought was a necessary step to get me where I want to be. \n\nFor reference, I'm in my first year. I enjoy the lab I joined but I've found that they largely work on basic science research whereas I'd prefer a nice balance between application and basic science with a heavier emphasis on application.",
