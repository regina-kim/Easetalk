After several months of working on applications and convincing myself that I was not going to get any offers and this was the end of my academic career, last week I got my dream offer at my dream institution, the place I've wanted to go for years. So why am I terrified instead of excited? I thought this would mean I could finally breathe, but if anything my anxiety is worse. Does anyone else relate to this and if so, how did you address it?",
