I'm starting an MPH program in the Spring at a different school. \n\nThere are only about 5 weeks of the semester left (this was my first semester), and I'm exhausted. My mom has been critically sick, and I've gotten really behind in some of my classes. I could email professors and probably get extensions, but I'm ready to drop out. I never plan on going back to the MSW program and I lack any motivation to finish. Although, I could push through.  \n\nMy gut instinct is to just withdraw, but my first thought is not always my best. :) \n\nWhat would you do if you were me? ",
