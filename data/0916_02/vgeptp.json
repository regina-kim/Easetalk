  "concern": "title: I'm having a hard time deciding what to do after I graduate. Should I go for an associates or masters? If associates, is there a way I can do 2 at the same time with schools that don't offer dual enrollment (from what I know)?\nThis might be very detailed, and I have several dilemmas to cover. I'll try to get it all in one go.\n\nI'm graduating with a bachelors in graphic design this December, and I've been thinking of either going for associates or a masters. I don't know which one would benefit me the most, but also with a masters there's a problem: my grades have always been low. I struggle with a LOT of mental health issues and I'm lucky to even still be in school. I got myself  together and got the help I needed, but unfortunately the damage  to my GPA is already done.  I figured since I might not get into a grad school, I could just get my associates.\n\nSo since grad school might not be an option, I wanted to think of backups. I was then thinking of doing associates, and that a lot of people to multiple. I decided I could do an associates in Fashion, and one in Music production. Music has always been a huge passion of mine, I want to learn how to create beats and music and maybe a little writing. I thought I could maybe find schools in NY that offer both, but it turns out thats not so much of an easy option either. TNS offers music, but not music production (as far as I'm aware of). But their fashion program is good and you can make good connections. I looked up some CUNY schools, Queens college offers a good music program and is way more affordable, but not a fashion associates.\n\nI thought about attending both at the same time, but I don't know if either of them offer dual enrollment, and I don't know how it works if you've already graduated with a Bachelors. I don't know if I'm able to attend both or not at all. Or if there are schools that offer both at a good balance.\n\nI want to hear some advice, or if there are other programs/directions that I'm not looking at or considering. ANY advice is very much appreciated! Also I really want to get this done in as little time possible. I lost so much time due to mental illness, I don't want to feel like I'm wasting more time.\n\nTLDR (kinda): Basic list of my questions:\n\nShould I go for masters or associates in the fields I'm looking into (music production and fashion)?Do I still have a chance at getting into grad school?Am I able to do 2 associates in different schools that don't offer dual enrollment (as far as I'm aware)?Are there other schools that offer both associates or is there another way I can achieve this goal of mine that I just haven't seen yet?\n\nEdit: I REALLY want to emphasize the not wasting time part. I lost YEARS due to really bad mental illness. I don't want to wait around anymore. I'm set on continuing school on these majors that are unrelated to my bachelors. I just don't know the best way, which is what I want to know. Regardless, I still will be establishing my career, but I do want to do the rest of the things I want to do in my life. And I don't want to be \"find out later\" what works the best for me. I want to just do it all now. I hope this makes sense and thanks to everyone for the advice already given.",
