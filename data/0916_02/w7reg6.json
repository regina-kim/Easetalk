  "concern": "title: Engineering —&gt; Psychology\nI’m starting university this Fall, in Mechanical Engineering. I chose it because I liked woodworking and metalworking in high school, and thought it’d be a stable career.  \n\nHowever, I have pretty split interests. Before I settled on an Engineering start, I was also considering English, Political Science, or Psychology. Thinking practically, for my situation I’ve ruled out English and Poli Sci as degree prospects, but am still curious about Psychology.\n\nOnly thing is, I’m aware that I might like it in theory, but that it might not be a feasible career. My plan is to explore it as a minor after talking to my advisor, but I’m not sure how close to the actual major that would be. Plus, I’ve had college students tell me that minors in a different field than your major can often deviate your focus.\n\nSo Psychology majors, do you think it’s worth such a big switch? Pros and cons of the major?\n\n—\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much everyone for the insight! I see now that a degree in Psychology, while versatile, is most effective with a PhD or some sort of further study behind it, but on its own can be difficult to hold down a career with. I’ll stick with Engineering, but will continue to explore Psych as a minor/hobby, and will look into human psychology aspects of Engineering/A.I. going down the line as well. \n\nThanks again, I’m excited to see what comes of this!!",
