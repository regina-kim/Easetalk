  "concern": "Im a sophomore at a state school in New England and I kind of hate it. The academics are pretty good but it can be hard to get support sometimes especially having a learning disability. I’m also from the Midwest so I’m very far from home and I miss my family. The food here sucks (which I know is most schools) and I pay $5k a year  and still buy groceries often. Plus I don’t have a car so I have to hope there’s a bus because it’s dangerous to walk there and half an hour each way. \nMy dorm is also a shithole. No matter how many times I Lysol and vacuum, there’s a stench that’s ingrained in the carpet. The rooms are so small and have a tiny window which looks like a prison cell. Everything is super outdated and they don’t ever clean the rooms. \nAs for social life, it’s weird here. You can’t just go to frat parties you have to have a ticket and pay. Which is annoying because I joined a sorority partially to get tickets and to make friends but it’s cliquey and we aren’t very involved in the community or on campus. There’s other parties here but they’re super hard to get into. I do like the student bands that put on concerts. There’s also not a lot of school spirit which sucks because there’s not a good sense of community. \nI like my friends and the clubs and classes and campus is pretty but there’s just so many issues. I’ve thought of transferring but I’m scared I won’t like it there either and I’ll lose all my friends and struggle to make new ones.",
