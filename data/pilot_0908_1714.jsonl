Until this week, I had been at my parents' house doing online school from there. While I'm definitely not the biggest proponent of online school, I was actually really enjoying life at home. I got to focus on doing readings and work without worrying about maintaining my own living space, I didn't have a commute to and from classes, and I really enjoyed hanging out with my family every day. Now I'm in a different city which is still pretty shut down from the pandemic, living alone, I can't see anyone, I haven't been able to focus on my coursework that much, and I just feel really *lonely* especially since the people in my cohort aren't keen on getting together due to the pandemic. Even though I absolutely love my program and what I'm studying, I'm starting to question if it's worth the lifestyle choices that are necessary (e.g., moving away from home, the job search being global rather than local). Now, I'm finding myself wishing the weeks would pass until I can go back during the break. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way and how they cope with it. I'm also wondering if moving away for grad school is that much better if there weren't a pandemic shutting everything down\/limiting any social activities; especially since so many people refer to grad school as an isolating experience anyway.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello!

{"id":"119bwqj","timestamp":1677024000000,"category":"school_life","concern":"I graduated college less than a year ago (May 2022); and my undergraduate experience was already screwed up by COVID-19 - I was forced to skip out on a full year before returning to Senior year because the US did not allow international students to take hybrid classes and my university was not offering at least 3 in-person classes for me during the 2020 - 2021 lockdown. So I got to watch all my friends graduate without me; I did qualify for an accelerated Master's Program in Economics and I was accepted but I opted not to pursue it due to COVID-19 and feeling that I did not want to stay in Fordham for both undergraduate and graduate school.  \n\n\nAnyway, I somehow managed to get a short-term contract at the World Bank since they hired people from around the world, and if I work for the World Bank in a full-time job for about 15 years I am eligible for permanent residency (green card). For all intents and purposes I really want to stay and live and build a life in the US (especially now with geopolitical events in SE Asia). The problem is that I don't have options for employment in the private sector because the H1-b process is absurdly random and difficult; and the World Bank and IMF have outright told me that I can't get a fulltime job without AT LEAST a Master's Degree (it's already brutally difficult for me to get even a short-term contract role, let alone a fulltime job); and even this employment is not guaranteed.  \n\n\nI'm thinking of getting a Master's Degree in Statistics or Data Science (an MBA or Master's degree in economics isn't very helpful) but I have checked that I did not take enough undergrad courses in Math or Computer Science to qualify (at least in the US). I'm fairly certain that my math skills and coding skills are nowhere near good enough for grad school (I struggled for a 3.60 gpa even before COVID-19)  \nI'm honestly totally lost because I'm being forced to prepare for grad school so soon, just after I managed to find something solid career-wise (I'm 23 turning 24). Otherwise I have to go back to the Philippines and I probably won't have an opportunity to immigrate elsewhere anymore.  \n\n\nAny advice for my circumstances?","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hi there!

{"id":"1fwghnn","timestamp":1728086400000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"As the title says my roommate doesn’t clean up after themself. Now our room isn’t a complete disaster and it’s mainly their side (plus our bathroom but it’s kinda 70\/30 on who makes the most mess of it) but they just don’t really clean up. They have cups and cans and bottles all over their nightstand and desk and have even had a cup under their bed on the dresser before, and they’re never empty either. They also go home every weekend so they don’t really have dishes or real food here so they’re all Starbucks and Dunkin’ cups, so half full coffees just sitting there separating for weeks as they go home and come back. They do sorta clean it after a few weeks, I’ve seen them bag up the cups and other garbage, but they don’t take it out. They have bags full of garbage in the corner on their side of the room and our rooms not big so it’s starting to creep towards our closet almost in the way of it. As for the bathroom they leave hair everywhere and I know it’s theirs and not mine because it’s their little rubber bands with the hair. Now like I said I am also at fault for the the bathroom being messy but I try to keep it somewhat clean by taking out the garbage and have cleaned the shower drain but they don’t even try to clean up a bit. I don’t know how they don’t get embarrassed when they have a friend over or even just with me being here. I get embarrassed having 2 cans on my desk and a few dirty forks or spoons for a few days because I’m too tired to wash them yet. Otherwise they’re a good roommate it’s just they never clean. I should also say they had a single room last year so it definitely feels like part of the reason since they would be used to not sharing a space but I want to have friends over and I’m embarrassed for my roommate.

I am a CS grad student, so all of my works are done behind a few monitors.  Every time I take a break, whether it be for lunch or for once-in-hours break, once I start taking a break, I get so absorbed into it that I cannot get out of it. Most commonly, I watch YouTube videos (streams &amp; stuff) during breaks because I don't know what else to do during the break and I find this activity the most amusing.  I have tried using a timer, but I tend to give myself extra few minutes over and over, and eventually not stopping, ugh! I also heard having a regular schedule might help, but I'm not sure how to set a regular schedule given that my work only involves research (no workout, nada) and it's difficult to get out of break in the first place.\n\nI don't know if this is common, but I am the guy who gets immersed into work very quickly and likes to continue working straight, until my day's work gets to the end. Yes, I prefer work without breaks.  However, people say it's important to take breaks, and there is also some unskippable breaks like lunch and dinner.  What is the way to have a healthy break that does not break my work momentum?\n\nNow, some may recommend working out, but I unfortunately am a \"strong\" at-home person and doesn't really like working out.

{"id":"11v1z0j","timestamp":1679097600000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"My 2 year program has a cohort of 30 people and I feel like I’m always finding out about gatherings after the fact. Last semester, I consistently saw Snapchat\/IG stories and updates on bar hang outs, games, and more literally every week. Sometimes even more. But they were usually during or after the event. I tried to participate but how am I supposed to attend if I had no idea it was happening? And it’d get awkward when I was asking “what’s going on?” or “what are you guys talking about?”. Someone once even said “Poor (my name), she keeps thinking there’s a group chat for this when we plan it spontaneously”. I just get left out because no one tells me. I get that I’m more introverted, but I really do try to talk and participate in conversations and have been mistaken as an extrovert by an extrovert before. I’ve really worked on this over the years. And other introverts in the class somehow also find out about the events, parties, and gatherings. \n\nPart of me felt ok - I tried to make myself feel better by saying that those people just don’t have a life outside of the program. And that I wanted to have more of a balance. Seeing the same people 5 days a week a day PLUS some evenings and most weekends is a lot! On top of 5-6 classes and student clubs and volunteering, I have a GA position, casual job, serious relationship, family, and other friends to balance. I feel ridiculous and in the minority for feeling this way. \n\nNow that it’s March, there seems to be less of these events happening second semester, but it still hurts when someone sends a video or picture (e.g. group selfie) to the cohort group text and it’s like almost everybody is in it. This literally happened last night at 2AM for someone’s st patty party. I can’t silent the notifications or not check because sometimes there are important announcements to know. I try to shrug it off and not let it get to me but I feel ashamed that I’ve cried over this before.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello! I'm glad you're here today.

You feel anxious because it's affecting your accommodations and you're unsure of the best way to handle it.

Would you like to explore options for what to include in your email or discuss any potential barriers you might face in this process?\nclient: client: I think exploring what to include in the email would be helpful. I'm worried about wording it right and making sure I don't overstep by discussing this over email.\ntherapist: therapist: It's understandable to be concerned about wording and not wanting to overstep. Let's consider a few key points you might include, like your need for a designated seat and how it affects your learning. You could also express your openness to any suggestions your professor might have. What do you think about these options?\nclient: client: I think those points sound good. I want to make sure I'm clear about why I need the seat and that I'm open to finding a solution. I just want to make sure my professor understands where I'm coming from.\ntherapist: Therapist: You've done a great job outlining what you want to communicate to your professor. It’s important to be clear about your needs while also being open to collaboration. By expressing how a designated seat impacts your learning and inviting your professor's suggestions, it shows your willingness to work together for a solution. Remember, taking this step is a positive move towards managing the situation and reducing your anxiety. \n\nAs a next step, you could draft your email and take some time to review it before sending it. I’m confident you’re capable of addressing this issue thoughtfully. If you need any further support or want to practice any part of this, feel free to reach out. You're making great progress, and I believe in your ability to handle this!\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate your support. I'll try drafting the email and see how it feels.

It's overwhelming and I don't know if I can handle it without having some kind of breakdown.\ntherapist: It sounds like the idea of being in large social situations feels overwhelming for you, and you're worried about how you might react. Can you share more about what it is about these situations that feels most challenging for you?\nclient: I think it’s mostly the pressure to be \"on\" all the time, like having to make small talk or not knowing what to say. I get so anxious that I just freeze or want to avoid things altogether.\ntherapist: It sounds like the pressure to always be engaged and make conversation is really tough for you, and it leads to feelings of anxiety that make you want to avoid these situations. What do you think it might be like if you felt more comfortable in these scenarios?\nclient: If I felt more comfortable, maybe I wouldn't feel so much dread about every little interaction. I could probably go through the day without constantly worrying about messing up or saying the wrong thing. \ntherapist: It sounds like feeling more comfortable could really ease the dread and allow you to go through your day with less worry. What would be different in your life if that weight was lifted, and how might that align with any goals you have for yourself?\nclient: I think I'd be able to focus more on my studies without the constant background noise of anxiety. Maybe I could even make some friends or join a club, things that seem impossible right now.\ntherapist: It sounds like reducing that anxiety could really open up opportunities for you, like focusing more on your studies and building social connections. On a scale from 0 to 10, how confident do you feel about moving towards feeling more comfortable in these situations?\nclient: Honestly, probably around a 3. It just feels like such a big leap from where I am now, you know?\ntherapist: Therapist: It makes sense that it feels like a big leap right now. What do you think might help increase your confidence, even just a little bit, to take those first steps towards feeling more comfortable?\nclient: I'm not really sure, but maybe breaking things down into smaller steps could help. Like, if I could manage smaller interactions without freaking out, maybe that'd make the bigger ones less scary.\ntherapist: Therapist: Breaking things down into smaller steps sounds like a thoughtful approach. What might be a small step that feels manageable to you right now, and how could that connect to reducing the anxiety you're experiencing?\nclient: client: Maybe starting by saying hi to someone in my dorm or classroom, just something really low-pressure. If I can get used to that, it might make the idea of longer conversations less intimidating.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're considering some manageable steps that align well with your goal of reducing anxiety. Saying hi to someone is a great start and shows your willingness to push your boundaries a little. How do you feel about trying this out, and what difference might it make in your day-to-day experiences?\nclient: I feel a bit nervous about trying it out, but I know it's necessary to make progress. If I can manage to do it, even occasionally, it might make daily interactions less daunting over time.\ntherapist: It's understandable to feel a bit nervous, but it's encouraging to hear that you recognize the importance of taking those steps. What might it mean for you and your confidence if you start to see progress in these daily interactions?\nclient: If I start seeing progress, it might help me feel more comfortable in other social situations. Gaining a little confidence could make the thought of interacting with people less overwhelming.\ntherapist: Therapist: Gaining that confidence could open up new possibilities for you socially. What is it about feeling more comfortable in social situations that matters to you personally?\nclient: Feeling more comfortable would make daily life and school a lot less stressful. It’d be nice to not feel so drained or on edge all the time when I'm around people.\ntherapist: Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful shift for you. Reducing that stress could really enhance your daily life. On a scale of 0 to 10, how confident do you feel about taking these steps toward more comfortable social interactions?\nclient: client: Honestly, I'd say maybe a 4 or 5. I'm aware it's a starting point, but it's still pretty daunting to think about.\ntherapist: Therapist: It's great that you recognize a starting point, even if it feels daunting. Given that, let's explore some steps you could take to gradually build that confidence. Based on what you've shared, possible options could include practicing small interactions daily or joining a group activity that interests you. What do you think about these ideas, or do you have other steps in mind?\nclient: client: I think starting with small interactions sounds more manageable for now. Joining a group activity seems a bit much at the moment, but maybe I can work up to it.\ntherapist: Starting with small interactions seems like a good first step. What might be a specific goal you can set for yourself around this? Also, how do you think you could approach any challenges you might encounter along the way?\nclient: I think a specific goal could be to say hi to someone new in one of my classes each week. As for challenges, maybe reminding myself that it's okay if it doesn't go perfectly might help.\ntherapist: That's a great, manageable goal you've set for yourself - saying hi to someone new each week can really help build that social confidence over time. And it's wonderful to hear you're giving yourself permission to not be perfect; that's a crucial part of growth. As you take these steps, remember that each interaction is a step forward, no matter how it goes. Be kind to yourself, and celebrate your efforts along the way. As a next step, perhaps you could make a plan to reflect on your progress weekly. You might jot down how each interaction felt and what you learned from it. I'm confident that you'll find this journey rewarding, and I'll be here to support you as you continue. Remember, making these small changes can have a big impact over time. You've got this!\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate the encouragement. I'll definitely give the reflection idea some thought and see how it goes.","completed":false}

{"id":"yllvzt","timestamp":1667520000000,"category":"emotional","concern":"TW: self harm \n\nI am a 5th year in college who is non-traditional student aged. I was previously academically dismissed and worked so hard to get back into my college and I did! The community college classes I took in the time between was so easy and I didn’t really learn to cultivate better habits as I was able to quickly do work and still get As, which felt good, but not the same at a 4 year college. I have been diagnosed with ADHD\/ anxiety\/ depression since the 5th grade and didn’t start utilizing accommodations until high school. Used them and did great. College is another story as I started to having to advocate for myself and thought all of my negative symptoms were how everyone felt and who I was. I never saw those things as barriers, but as I have gotten older, the dots have started clicking. I have been embarrassed to use my accommodations until this year because past friends made comments that it’s unfair and I took those to heart. The academic resource center purged my files upon my dismissal so it’s been a mess trying to get the correct documentation and my doctor only sent in the documentation last week even though I was asking for months. I am very frustrated as I’ve been falling behind due to my mental health rapidly declining this semester upon starting a new medication that made everything worse: insomnia, more anxiety, not taking care of myself, thoughts of unaliving myself, and started c*tting myself for a few weeks. I started to make the connection that it was my new med I started and then cut it cold Turkey and have felt better, but I’m still in a disassociative state making functioning hard. I am scared to disclose all of this as I can’t afford to medically withdraw and am supposed to graduate in the spring.

It would be nice to feel like I'm on top of things instead of constantly playing catch-up.\ntherapist: Having less anxiety and more time to relax and connect with friends sounds like it could bring a lot of joy and balance to your life. What steps do you think you might take to start moving toward that vision?\nclient: I guess I could start by talking to my manager about adjusting my work hours or maybe try experimenting with different study techniques to see what sticks. Also, I might need to set a more structured routine for myself to make sure I actually stick to what I plan out.\ntherapist: Based on what you've shared, possible options might include talking to your manager about adjusting work hours and experimenting with new study techniques. Setting a structured routine sounds like a key step too. What first step do you feel most ready to take, and how might you overcome any barriers you anticipate?\nclient: I feel like talking to my manager about adjusting my work hours could be a good first step because it might give me those consistent study blocks. The main barrier I see is convincing them to change my schedule, but maybe if I explain my situation as a student, they'll understand.\ntherapist: That sounds like a well-thought-out plan. You're ready to take that first step by having a conversation with your manager about your work hours. Explaining your situation as a student could help them understand your needs better. It’s great to see that you’re considering new study techniques and a structured routine to keep you on track. Remember, the goal is to reduce stress and create more balance in your life. You’re working towards gaining more control, which is truly commendable. \n\nFor your next steps, focus on preparing for that conversation with your manager. Think about what you might want to say and consider any compromises you might be willing to make. As you try out new study techniques, pay attention to what works best for you. \n\nRemember, creating balance is a journey, and each step you take brings you closer to feeling less anxious and more in control. You’ve got this, and you’re not alone in the process. If you ever need support or a sounding board, I'm here for you.\nclient: Thanks, I'll definitely keep that in mind. It might be a bit nerve-wracking, but knowing you're here helps.","completed":false}
{"id":"znn21k","timestamp":1671148800000,"category":"school_life","concern":" A blurb on my situation and why I’m asking this: I’m currently in my school’s business program (includes majors in finance, economics, info sys, marketing, etc) with the aim of graduating with a bachelors in management information systems, however calculus has been a major roadblock for me.   \nI barely passed precalculus at a cc the first time I took it, failed calculus at the cc, then had to retake precalculus due to credit issues when transferring but failed it this time, and now I’ll need to take calculus again at a cc, and I have little hope that I’ll pass. I have a deadline to pass that class this next semester and if I don’t I’ll be kicked from the business program and won’t have access to any of the above listed majors. Already the prospects of having a nice info sys job are starting to dim. The only major I can think of that will allow me to not take calculus and graduate in a reasonable time is interdisciplinary studies. My remaining classes until I graduate would be poli sci because why not, I think it’s an interesting subject and there’d be no point to taking my remaining business or finance or information systems classes if I can’t have that major at the end of it.  \n\n\n..  \n\n\nTl;dr I suck at calculus  \n\n\nSo basically what my two questions are: will I be stuck working minimum wage jobs with the degree in the title or is there some hope for a “normal” working-in-an-office job?  \nWhat are some jobs that are open to both business and political science majors (because I’m assuming that’s where I’d most likely be heading with this plan)?","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello!

What might help you move from a 4 or 5 to feeling more confident, say around a 6 or 7, as you work to create this new structure?\nclient: client: I think maybe having a plan or some guidance on where to focus my study efforts would help. Maybe if I could find someone to study with or resources similar to the ones I had in high school, I'd feel better about it.\ntherapist: It's great that you're identifying what could help increase your confidence. It seems like having a study partner or similar resources might bridge that gap for you. What resources or people do you think you could reach out to, to provide that support or guidance as you prepare for your test?\nclient: client: I guess I could start by reaching out to some classmates from my high school who might be in a similar boat, or maybe there's an online study group I could join. I could also check if there are any tutoring services or workshops offered by the school.\ntherapist: Those sound like solid ideas to build a supportive study environment. Based on what you mentioned, possible steps might be reaching out to old classmates, looking for online study groups, and checking out school resources like tutoring or workshops. What do you think about starting with one of these actions, and how do you envision overcoming any barriers that might arise?\nclient: I think reaching out to old classmates could be a good start, since we already know each other and might be going through the same thing. As for barriers, maybe just coordinating schedules could be tricky, but I’m hoping once we start talking, it’ll work itself out.\ntherapist: It sounds like you've really thought this through, and it's wonderful to see you taking proactive steps to prepare for your test. Reaching out to old classmates is a fantastic idea, and it's great that you're considering how to navigate potential scheduling issues. You've got a clear path ahead: connecting with your peers and exploring additional resources like online groups or school workshops. As you work on these steps, remember that your past successes are a testament to your resilience and capability. Trust in your ability to recreate a supportive study routine. Your plan is well on its way, and I believe in your ability to overcome any challenges. If you ever feel stuck or need further support, reaching out to school advisors or counselors could also be beneficial. Keep up the great work, and remember, you're not alone in this journey.\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate that. I’ll definitely keep those options in mind and see how it goes.","completed":false}
