  "concern": "title: Bumbling through the admissions cycle\nSo this is my second admissions cycle applying to MA and Ph.D. programs. I was accepted to a couple of programs last year but didn't receive enough funding, so did not enroll. I've mostly decided that I won't go through another cycle if I don't get enough funding this year because the rest of my life has been in limbo while trying to determine if I'm moving/departing from my LTR/etc. I could change my mind after a week of good rest but who knows when that will be.\n\nPart of me also feels so tired from the whole process. I work full time and was taking classes part-time for a number of years and then doing all of this freelance work to build my CV *and then* working on my application materials. I've been extremely lucky in that I did very well in my classes and also had a ton of opportunities come my way. I love learning and researching so much, and wish to be doing it full-time instead of splitting my efforts. I've already been through a 1-year grad program, and know how intense that year was. The work itself doesn't phase me since I'm used to working 50 - 60 hours a week between my job and whatever else I get myself into. Okay, I'm a bit of a workaholic. And I am legitimately tired. \n\nI also feel like I am stumbling through the admissions process even though I had some guidance (non-profit program for underserved students). The admissions process is not intuitive and sometimes I feel like a deer in headlights, and I spend days cringing over a wrong step. Anyone else?",
