  "concern": "title: Panicking about not finding a permanent lab after rotations\nI'm freaking out. This is my first year of grad school and in my program (bio) you rotate through up to 3 labs before choosing where to stay permanently. I started my #2 rotation recently and thought all was good. However, the PI told me on day 1 of the rotation that the funding situation had changed for the worse and he couldn't commit to keeping me on longterm. I couldn't believe it because I had asked about this before rotating. No matter though, I can go back to lab #1 though right? NOPE, turns out that PI said almost word for word the same thing.\n\nI don't think this is about my performance since the #2 PI told me before I had even had a chance to do any work. Also, we have a group Whatsapp chat for our cohort and a lot of people are hearing similar things. One person's rotation PI said it is because there was a protest and stipends went up by a lot so PIs are now saying they can't afford to take new people on.\n\nI can't stop picturing the worst outcomes. What if I can't find a lab, do I have to drop out of the program? I gave up so much to come here, broke my lease, quit my job, even ended a relationship. What do I do?",
