  "concern": "title: Starting my non-thesis paper\nSo it’s my last semester of my Master’s (History), assuming I graduate in May. I know I need to do more on my paper (AKA actually write it so I can finish it). I started in November, but only because I had a meeting with one of my advisors and needed to show where I was with my argument. I had about 15 or so pages done, mostly introduction but a brief overview of my main tenets. \n\nI sent this draft to this same advisor and he has NEVER gotten back to me with feedback despite in-person requests. He also never returned my seminar research paper with any feedback, (completed in December), despite multiple in-person requests. Nor did the historiography seminar paper I completed for another class (different professor) get returned with any feedback, despite an email request. \nMy other advisor, whom I work for as a research assistant, briefly talks to me about ideas but our conversations skew back towards their work 75% of the time. \n\nI’ve been reading endlessly, it seems, and have a clearer idea of where I want to take my argument. But I’m finding it hard to start writing again without receiving feedback for my last seminar papers, which contained the foundation l of my argument, my thoughts on the trajectory of the field, and what I feel like my contribution adds to my field.\n\nLooking for advice and encouragement on how to proceed when I feel like what I’m saying (and requesting in follow-up!) is clearly not worth anyone’s time.",
