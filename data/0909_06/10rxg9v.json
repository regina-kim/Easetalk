It seems to take me forever - maybe two or three hours for one source - and I feel like I should be writing more...but I can't write until I've read, right?\n\nHow long does it take you to go through one academic source (maybe 25 pages including references on average)? Do you have strategies to go faster? Am I being too thorough?",
