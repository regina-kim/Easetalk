  "concern": "title: The math is NOT adding up.\ntldr: Master's tuition rates may sink me into a 5+ year financial hole. Is there more pain than gain? \n\nAs I prepare to  transition to graduate school directly from undergrad, the only problem I'm facing is the issue of funding. My top programs are asking for tuition on par with entry-level salary in my field. I'm wondering if I should've attended a cheaper undergrad uni, but the opportunities I had access to here is part the reason I was admitted this round.\n\nLet's say I can handle (take out loans) the MS tuition for 2 years. Then is a PhD next? A solid 3-7 years of (maybe) being funded with a living stipend (perhaps) that would leave me barely breaking even with living expenses and definitely incapable of paying back student loans. I guess the best path would've been going straight from BS to PhD, but COVID-19 in the middle of my undergraduate years cancelled a couple of research opportunities that I would've taken advantage of otherwise; thus, I wouldn't be as strong of a candidate for PhD programs. \n\nI will be the first in my family to attend graduate school, if we can find a way to afford it. I have no idea when the finances are supposed to make sense. Is industry before grad school a better deal to avoid soul-crushing debt? Has anyone regretted grad school, especially a Master's, for financial reasons? How do I know if I making the worst money mistake of my life!?\n\nEdit: I'm in Aerospace Engineering (urban planning 2nd-major) with interest in space infrastructure. Thank you all so much for the helpful advice, feeling 10x more equipped to choose the appropriate next steps in my career.",
