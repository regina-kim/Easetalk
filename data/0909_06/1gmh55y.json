My parents keep hounding me about getting my masters degree yet the problem is that I don’t have any professors to ask for letters of recommendation. I was never really too close to them and wouldn’t go to that many office hours since I never really needed to. A lot of the classes I took I would get A’s so I didn’t really see the need to go to office hours and it’s just weird to be there for non-class related reasons. I was involved with an extra-curricular so I didn’t really get into any research. At this point am I screwed if I can’t get any jobs and can’t get a masters degree. ",
