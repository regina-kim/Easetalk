By shifting your focus to these steps, you’re creating a framework that celebrates your achievements on your terms. It's encouraging to hear you’re considering these changes.\n\nTo ensure you're moving forward with this, perhaps start by identifying a couple of mentors you trust and respect. Reaching out to them for feedback might offer fresh perspectives and valuable encouragement. Additionally, setting specific, achievable milestones can be a motivating way to track your progress and enjoy small wins along the way.\n\nRemember, your skills and accomplishments are evident in how the company values you, and that’s no small feat. Keep nurturing the belief in your capabilities, as it's a powerful ally on your journey.  \n\nFor the next week, try reaching out to at least one new mentor and define one personal milestone you'd like to achieve. If you'd like to share your experiences or need further support, I'm here for you. Keep up the great work!",

  "concern": "title: I got asked to return to my internship for the summer and I can't even feel happy bc of how my advisor acts about it\nWhen I got an internship this past semester and I told my advisor I was at least expecting a congratulations but they didn't really even say anything. I'm doing well in it though and they already asked me to return for the summer. It's amazing how valued I feel there but I'm still having trouble feeling happy for this because I know my advisor isn't going to be happy. Even though they've shown repeatedly they only want me to be a means to their tenure I still want to make them happy. I don't get it. \n\nYou all have skills and value outside of academia though. Don't ever forget that or let others treat you like you don't.",
