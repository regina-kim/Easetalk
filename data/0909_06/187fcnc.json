Cal states are due in February/March. I completely underestimated how long it'd take to draft my personal statements and get solid letters of recommendation. I'm now scrambling to find professors who will give me (most likely mediocre) letters of rec (I have 2/3 atm), and just barely finishing up a rough draft of my personal statements. Should I even bother applying to the UC's at this point? Or just cut my losses and put more effort into my Cal State apps? ",
