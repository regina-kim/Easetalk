Promotions at work, make solid friends, a family, a stupid dog, a beautiful house, a healthy life, attending family celebrations, birthdays, retirement parties, sharing beautiful memories with your family and the stupid dog, a man/woman/they cave, vacations, start a business, learn a trade and start your own company, seeing the birth of your kids and seeing them grow to become their own person, grow physically and mentally as well adjusted person in society, eat healthy, have a nice car (not a damm super car), and finally, just become the best person you can be.\n\nAnd…what do I have now? Student debt and a PhD in biochemistry… \n\n\nEdit: ok, when I was writing this I should have been more careful with the language \n\n“if someone sees this read it carefully… I can promise you will miss out on so much and maybe some of the stuff I just mentioned only for the bragging rights of being called Doctor “last name”.",
