Just curious if anyone else had a story to share similar to this.\n\nThe person I know was in residency after med school. Due to a terribly designed program and unnecessary overwork, a record number of 4 residents dropped out. It’s very rare for residents to leave a residency program. One left medicine altogether. My acquaintance took a year off, had a baby, then had to reapply for a new specialty.\n\nSometimes people in positions of authority suck; sometimes it’s just not a good fit; sometimes you’re in a program for the wrong reasons; sometimes you get triggered and have a nervous breakdown; sometimes you find out about some corruption or widely accepted nonsense in your industry that turns you off… \n\nAnd I’m sure a myriad other situations and outcomes.\n\nSo what happened to you, what did you do about it, and how are you doing now?",
