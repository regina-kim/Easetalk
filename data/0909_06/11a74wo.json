It's understandable to feel hesitant about how they'll respond, but many educators are willing to help when they understand the situation.\n\nAs you move forward, remember that it's okay to adjust your plan as you learn what works best for you. A helpful strategy might be setting reminders or alarms to take breaks, ensuring you give yourself that necessary downtime. You're showing a lot of insight by prioritizing both your academic and personal well-being.\n\nLet's aim to draft a simple plan together for those study boundaries and the approach to talk with your professors. As you try these new strategies, know that you have the resilience to navigate through the challenges. Keep us updated on how things go, and know that I'm here to support you along the way.",

I’m sleeping so little just to get by in these classes. I don’t know if I can even make it to finals. \n\nHas anyone withdrawn from an entire semester of PhD classes? Did it affect your future employment or did it seemed frowned upon in interviews? \n\nIt’s too late to drop so these classes will still show up on my transcript and I am worried I’ll have to explain to interviewers why I quit in the middle of the semester.",
