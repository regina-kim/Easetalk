  "concern": "title: Not very interested in the project that my PI wants me to work on\nHey guys,\n\nIm a Masters student and I joined this group 3 months ago, I have been working on another project with a grad student and now my PI wants me to work individually on another project. He pitched me two projects and both projects although related to the project that I have been assisting, are very different from my research interests and the project that I was assisting. When I joined the group, I was briefed on the project that the graduate student was working one and I assumed that I would be working on a similar project, as this aligns with my research interests.  \n\nHow do I handle this situation?\n\nThank You",
