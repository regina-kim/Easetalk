  "concern": "title: Life stressors, grades and finishing- Long post.\nI just feel the need to share this as it feels cathartic to release this into the internet void. I have had the absolute worst life circumstances thrown my way while trying to complete and pass my classes for my degree. I started school in Fall 2021 with an accelerated program to finish in a year. Previously to starting school, my parents, who were married for 33 years, abruptly and sadly ended their marriage. My dad, who was in my life sort of consistently, completely abandoned, and left our family never to talk to us again. He married another woman who was horrific and edged us out of his life. My mom, who was extremely dependent on my dad, lost everything including her money. She was always sort of absent but it became much worse and devastating to witness and put a lot of pressure on me to help her out. Especially when COVID hit, that added a lot more pressure in general. I don't say this lightly but it absolutely devastated me. I had terrible depression, OCD and awful anxiety, but nonetheless I started my program hoping to push that aside. Another thing to note, is that I came from a very religious background and through connecting the dots realized that it was actually a cult that my dad started and funded mid way through the semester. I realized how much control and manipulation both my parents had put me through my whole life. It was overwhelming to say the least. My brain sort of broke around mid terms and I was crying through every single test. I, of course failed those exams, because I was so devastated and hurt, shocked and in deep grief. I was taking shots of tequila in the AM to calm myself down before my classes and mid terms to try to work through the pain, but it was to no avail. To avoid failing my classes, I took a leave of absence and didn't take my finals. At the same time, I was let go of my part time job which was helping support me with living expenses during my time in school. Lastly, my marriage was really strained and felt like it was also falling apart. The amount of stress and grief was overwhelming, and I was in a such a low place that I checked myself into an IOP (intensive out patient) therapy center. So for the first part of 2022, I went to over 400 hours of therapy to heal myself and deal with the intense trauma of it all. I lived off of credit cards and money I had saved for myself to pay for my program. As the year progressed, I was able to come above water for the first time and start getting back into my program. I had to take every final and write all of my research papers almost a year later, while also completing the current fall semester. It was so difficult to recall the information, but I was able to scrape by and finish with not stellar grades but still passed. I also enrolled back into the fall semester of 2022 and am finishing up my program (hopefully) this spring. Unfortunately my grades were sub par my first semester that I may be below the graduation requirement (3.0) , but I am hoping that my program will allow me to still walk and just pass me so I can move on from this life. I had to take out loans to live while I am in school because it is so involved, I cut ties with my parents (I was really close with my mom so that hurt), and am grinding out this semester to finally fucking finish! This isn't a post about pushing through adversity or anything, it is just venting that, this whole experience has been so hard and I am ready to be done. Lastly, being in your 30's in school is EXTREMELY harder than when I was in my young 20's.",
