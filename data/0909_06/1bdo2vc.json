  "concern": "title: Is pursing a policy degree the right path for me?\nHi everyone, I recently applied to several MPA and MPP programs during the last application cycle and I have been admitted to Harris (20k) and Sanford (15k). In my opinion, these are both good schools. However, I've suddenly become hesitant about whether pursuing a policy degree is the right path for me.  \nMy ultimate goal is to go to law school, but since I didn't get a particularly strong LSAT score before last year's application cycle, I didn't apply last year. I ended up applying to mpp and mpa since I have a genuine interest in various aspects of social policy (exclusion, gentrification, equality, etc.) and pursuing a policy degree would allow me to delve deeper into these fields.  \nSince my decision was made purely out of personal interest, do you guys think it's worth it? My family could support me financially, but still, the tuition is no small deal. And at least for now, I don't foresee myself working in a policy-relevant industry after graduating from law school.  \nIf I do decide to go, should I choose Sanford since Duke Law is my dream school?",
