  "concern": "title: I have a meeting with my thesis supervisor after not speaking to him for 9 months\nI'm so nervous. I have a meeting with my thesis supervisor that I haven't spoken to for 9 months. I have to finish my thesis this school year because otherwise my courses that I passed will expire. My thesis has become such a mountain and it's been getting harder and harder to even find the motivation to climb the first two feet. \n\nQuick background: Started college in september 2012, finished my bachelors in july 2018 because of several back surgeries and depression. Then started my masters in september 2018 and passed all my courses in july 2019. Then I had to start writing my thesis and then had a nervous breakdown. Like full on depressed wanted to die that kind of thing. Covid started, which I (luckily) wasn't that affected by.  I got diagnosed with autism (which explained a. lot.) Got depressed again, started having back issues again. My parents finally convinced me to move back with them. \n\nIt's been good. I have a job. My colleagues are really nice. My thesis supervisor is really nice. I have been very fortunate to have been born in a country in which college is relatively cheap and where mental care (and other healthcare is available and also relatively cheap). I have a loving family.\n\nBut that fucking thesis does my head in. I have anxiety attacks when I think about it. I stress about everyday but don't end up doing any work. I'm soooo close but I feel like a failure everytime I get feedback. And I lost all inspiration (if I had some in the first place.) \n\nI'm trying to pick myself up and get myself to work. But every tip and trick that is out there to get yourself started I just completely forget once the anxiety about the thesis lets itself know in my body. I just feel so horrible and want to do anything else not to feel all those knots in my stomach. I make up scenarios in my head where my thesis supervisor secretly hates me and thinks I'm a failure even though he's very kind. I think all my teachers think that I'm weak and weird and just find me a burden. I hate typing a paragraph and knowing it's going to be shit anyway. Graduatin college still feels so far out of my reach even though I have 14,000 word written that I hope aren't half bad.\n\nI'm just at a loss and wanted to get this of my chest. I'm meeting with him in half an hour and my heart is beating like crazy.",
