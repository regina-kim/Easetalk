  "concern": "title: switching phd due to bad fit\nI am first semester phd student from india .I am not a good fit at my current university So I want to drop my PhD here and start new at USA.  I made a terrible mistake while applying for indian university , I did not research fully about the indian university. My mistake is so bad that my area of research interest is not currently available at my university.\n\n  I feel like a moron by making this mistake.But I am a mature person now and I am doing extensive research about which universities I need to apply and enroll(if case i got admitted ).  My area is available at many universities at US and I talked with multiple professor and they said that there is vacancy in their lab and I can join them if I got admitted.In my past I made a mistake, but learned my lesson and I need a second chance to do my research.   \n\nI am planing to disclose this at SOP to avoid any academic dishonesty , will this hurt my application despite the fact that I understood my error and rectified it and have passion to do research? \n\nP.S : I am three internships at top universities (2 from TIFR india and one from MIT in USA) and a independent research  based on my research interest which might help me",
