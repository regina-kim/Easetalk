My experience was not very positive and the internship supervisor is a member of my evaluation committee. How honest should I be, or should I not do it at all?\nI didn't have the best experience in my internship due in large part to poor management by my internship supervisor, who will be reading my thesis and will be a member of my defense jury. I also think I could have found solutions to the problems if I had been more assertive and decisive, but I was so lost and confused for the first half of my internship that I didn't see the solutions until it was too late. I'm afraid that including all of this will paint both myself and my supervisor in a bad light, but I don't know what other Weaknesses and Threats to include in my SWOT analysis that don't risk doing either of these things. Should I be honest, or should I be more vague and downplay these elements (which I think risks coming across as evasive BS), or should I just ask my professor if I can send him the SWOT separately rather than as part of the thesis?",
