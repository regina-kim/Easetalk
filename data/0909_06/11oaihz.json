  "concern": "title: How to handle hostile listeners when presenting?\nI am a 1st year grad student and am currently preparing to present my research to the rest of my research group for the first time. While I am confident in my ability to field genuine questions about my work, I am anxious about dealing with one senior group member in particular.\n\nHaving been in this lab since undergrad, I routinely see him ask questions to presenters in group meeting that are intended to sow discomfort or undermine their confidence. It comes across as juvenile, in the sense that I don't believe he is asking out of legitimate curiosity but rather as a way to assert dominance among his peers. They tend to be tedious, hardly important questions, often requiring back-tracking after the presenter has moved on.\n\nHow have you dealt with people like this in your time in grad school? I don't want him to walk all over me, else he'll interpret me as an easy target and bother me more in the future. At the same time, I don't want to harm my reputation with an unprofessional response.",
