I decided to take the W rather than potentially fail. I'm now taking this class again. I hate myself for wasting my time but I hope I can survive. I am an idiot but I won't give up so maybe that will help. I work full time on the side and will put more time into it this time around. Anyway I thought I'd voice my rant here as no one else seems to understand.",
