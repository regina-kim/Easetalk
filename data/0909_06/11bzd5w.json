  "concern": "title: Anxiety about deadlines\nI work 30 hours a week over 4 days and 1 day a week I go to uni to study my Master’s. It’s a 2 year course and I’m in the 2nd year.\n\nMy deadlines are causing me anxiety, especially dissertation which is due on 29th September. The grade I get for dissertation will be counted as a double module, so there’s a lot of pressure. I get anxiety at night thinking about work and uni deadlines, and all the stuff I have to do the next day. \n\nMy uni have made this document with the ideal dissertation timeline, and it says we should get our literature review done by the end of February. It’s now the 25th and I’ve only done 900 words and I’m starting to panic.  I was even thinking about taking unpaid leave from work to try and finish my lit review. Annoyingly I have no leave left because I’ve had to use it for a uni field trip.\n\nI’m on track to finish the course- in the 8 assignments I’ve done I’ve got 2 distinctions (highest grade) 6 merits (middle grade) and 1 pass (lowest grade) But I’m not amazingly good at academic writing. In my undergraduate dissertation I didn’t do that well. I got 55% so a 2:2 grade, luckily somehow I still got a 2:1 overall for my degree. The pass mark for Master’s courses in England where I live is 50%. So I’m worried that I might not pass. Also I want to do primary research for my dissertation which is going to be very time consuming. Admittedly my undergrad dissertation was very rushed. I did the whole thing in 2 months including primary research. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips for how to keep anxiety at bay? Yoga and meditation help me, but I have to be soo consistent with them. This morning I didn’t meditate and I think that might be why I feel anxious now.",
