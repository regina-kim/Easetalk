  "concern": "title: Which program do I choose, better life, or more matching with current interests?\nI am tring to decide between two places: (mathematics PhD)\n\nProgram 1: has the best professors in research topic X and Y, and none are in research topic Z.  \nProgram 2: all professors are in topic Z, none are in topics X or Y.\n\nEvery professor in these programs has at least 4 papers in top journals (Acta, Annals, Invent., JAMS, Proc. ICM). I can't compare, except one professor in Program 1 is famous.\n\nI have no research experiences.\n\nI have done well on 2 graduate courses about topics X and Y respectively. Currently I like them. They are what attracted me to this field.  \nI took another course on a prerequisite (differential geometry) of topic Z, and didn't do well, maybe due to bad teaching. But:\n\nIn Program 1 I must do 20 hours of TA work every week, the stipend is low, and housing is far from the university and more expensive.  \nIn Program 2 almost no TA work is required, the stipend is high, and the housing is on campus. The peers are also stronger.\n\nWhich one do I go to? I need to decide before April 15.\n\nTell me if:\n\n* Doing well on 2 graduate courses is not enough to indicate research potential, so I should go to Program 2, or\n* I should pursue my current interest in Program 1 no matter what difficulty there is",
