As we wrap up today, keeping in mind your goals of organizing thoughts and setting boundaries, your action steps include using a planner app and writing down your goals. It's a wonderful start towards finding that balance you seek. If anything feels overwhelming, remember you can always adjust your plan. You’ve got a good foundation here, and I’m here to support you along the way. Looking forward to hearing how it goes next time we chat. Remember, you’re not alone in this.",

  "concern": "title: Feeling painfully unprepared for my quals this semester\nI'll keep the background short, but grad school has been a RIDE for me. Mental health? Questionable. Physical health? Dubious. New PI straight out of a post doc? On maternity leave for my first semester so my labmate and I were left to set up a brand new lab if that gives you any perspective- I don't have any work from past grad students that I can show as preliminary data, there were no experiments running when I came in, and my project is still not clearly defined. That last one is, admittedly, entirely my fault. I very much want to work on something that is within the scope of the lab, but that my PI has not worked on before personally.\n\nHere's the issue: she wants me to do my qualifying exam in January, but I still feel like I know nothing about the state of our field. It's small, and I think I know what's been looked at by the biggest group in the area, but I don't know if what I'm doing is too close to their work. I feel very overwhelmed when trying to write up my specific aims, because I don't know how big or small my scope should be considering that I have no data and will have to do 100% of the work myself. I've been trying to look for some resources on how to determine scope and things like that, but I've been reading for a good chunk of break and I actually feel more uncertain than when I started.\n\nIf anyone has thoughts on starting from the ground up like this, I would very much appreciate it. All my friends are in established labs with multiple undergrads, lab managers, post docs, and years of work to lean on but I feel like I'm in way over my head here.",
