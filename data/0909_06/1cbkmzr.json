Is it doable to start grad school when my future kids are school-age so that I at least have 8 hours of my day free for school/studying? I know *some* companies are willing to help with tuition a bit and there is a pharmacy intern license that can give me a slight raise for the duration of school but honestly, how do any of you afford grad school without parents helping a lot? Every school I’ve found says it’s about $100k.\n :( Fortunately I have nearly all the prereqs knocked out, except for a semester or two of STEM classes. I have an associates of arts, which I know, not great but my core is all done.",
