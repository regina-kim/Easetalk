I noticed how intrigued he was by everything in our lab (he is not in science or any science adjacent field). He was walking around touching all the instruments we had out, poking around (being mindful to not break or change anything) and was overall just very interested. \n\nIt made me think: not even I go around poking around my lab because I'm worried I'll break something. Even when I come across an issue in lab (this is my first time doing labwork in years), I email my advisors for help instead of poking around old data to see if anything matches up because I don't want to accidentally delete something.\n\nI guess it will take time to gain more confidence and I should probably up my anxiety meds but how are you usually in lab? Nervous or confidently inquisitive? I want to become like the latter but worried (ha) that I will never break out of my nervous shell.",
