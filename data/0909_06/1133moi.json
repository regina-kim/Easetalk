  "concern": "title: Can a PI extort you?\nI've posted here about this PI before, so look there for context. Short version: because other people in my lab have done virtually nothing to help me with this labor intensive developmental project, I had to shell out an extra 1k to register for this semester to finish my thesis. \n\nToday, I met with my PI to discuss the thesis, which I thought was coming to a close. Toward the end of the meeting, he asked me to start collecting data again so that we can publish. I told him that I'm not interested in doing that, because I want to concentrated on defending my thesis and getting my degree. He said something like, \"Well, the babies will age out if you wait any longer. It shouldn't take you that long to add the data.\" This pissed me off because he has no clue how long it takes to find parents, schedule appointments, run the study, code the data, compile the data, clean the data, and analyze it. I told him that I was hesitant to collect again after last summer when I spent my own time and money driving back and forth 6 hours to collect 85% of my sample in my hometown with no help from the lab. He said \"This isn't just a homework assignment. This is a job. If I don't get a publication out of this, I'm not interested in the project at all.\" I asked, \"Do you mean you wouldn't sign off on my thesis?\" and he said yes. Has anybody else dealt with something like this? Like, is this legal???\n\nEdit: For more clarification, I’m a master’s student who was supposed to defend in December 2022. I’m enrolling in a PhD program in the fall, so the legality thing is an exaggeration, but the PI being as asshole about this isn’t.",
