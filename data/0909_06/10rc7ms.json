  "concern": "title: Can Canadian Reserves summer training be balanced with grad school?\nI am attending a Canadian grad school and am in my first year of my Biology PhD. The PhD research requires sample collection and environmental surveying, which must take place from the spring to the fall.\n\nBecause the program pays poorly and has extremely limited teaching assistant options, I am attempting to join my local regiment as an Army Reservist because it pays and could potentially get me a foot in the door for a government pension down the line. However, the recruiting website states that at least 2 summers of 2 months of full-time work are required in order to achieve status as a reservist. This seems very likely to conflict with my most important research work, and my supervisor may not permit it because the university has strict rules about how many hours/week a student may work outside their program.\n\nHas anyone had any experience balancing the demands of working in the reserves with a graduate school program before? Is it reasonable to continue with my application to the Forces, or should I not bother?",
