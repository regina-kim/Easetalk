  "concern": "title: How to deal with a toxic labmate\nHello everyone, I previously posted about this person. Let’s call her Jenny for the sake of this post. \nJenny has been making my life a living hell. \nEvery movement I make, every letter i type on the keyboard what I eat, where I eat, it all causes Jenny to make a mockery out of me.\n\nNow, Jenny has been snitching on us so the dr responsible for our lab appointed her as our boss. She makes us go carry heavy stuff/ manual labor or go buy stuff she needs for her experiments and if we say NO she used the “I’m a boss here, if you don’t follow me i’ll tell the drs and you can be kicked out of the program” card. \nI have been her target for 2 years now and she is a semester behind in the program.\nToday we had a small celebration for one of our colleagues for successfully beating cancer. Let’s call that colleague Lily.\nNow Jenny got a cake without telling anyone that it was today, and when we wanted to pay our parts back she (Jenny) said : “ I only take payments in USD , Go to the exchanger and unless you bring me USD i am not accepting your payment. “ mind you that both pounds and USD are used here and our country’s pounds is more readily available for small payments. For example it is extremely difficult to find a 5$ bill but very easy to find it in pounds.\nIt is the way she gives orders and when i confront her she twists the scenario making it seem i am the one causing trouble and i am sick of it. \nIn front of us “ i am the best here you need to follow me” but if the drs give her a compliment she directly switches to “ on no , i’m feeling very humble! You’re giving me too much credit, I think the harmony in our lab is a team effort~”\nThe minute the drs walk out she’s like” are they stupid!”\nEven a few days ago, Lily received a call from someone who was getting treatment with her but wasn’t unfortunate enough to recover and that she wanted to talk to LiLy and bid her farewells and Jenny told Lily to block her ….\nAnother instance was she told me i wasn’t raised right because i said goodbye to my advisor not the other way around. \nShe also keeps criticizing that she is fed up with the speed of my typing, and no my paper has a deadline i am not stopping for her.\n3 years ago during masters Jenny was my roommate and her space was a mess .\nShe made up a no eating rule in the room yet she eats there herself and when i confronted her she said “ your food smells of spices mine doesn’t so i am allowed to eat here but you’re not”\nShe also told Lily that i was messy which LiLy replied to “ how could you live together with someone this messy, you poor thing must’ve been so stressed”\nWhile i swear to anything you believe in , that i used to tidy her spot if i just wanted to walk decently in the room.\nShe also made a “you’re not allowed to turn the AC rule” but when she was hot she turned it and said but i am hot, and when i told her when I was feeling hot you didn’t let me turn it on and she replied “but i wasn’t hot”\nThe other day she asked me why do you out spaces after semi columns. And at a conference abroad last year she said she didn’t need a sim . Bought one and put it in my phone, and out of nowhere she says “give me the sim i need to talk to my boyfriend”\nI said no. She stood on the sidewalk and yelled you piece of shit you’re not giving me the sim!!! You’ll see , i’ll harm you, you’ll see! Like she waited for the sim to be handed to her.\nAnd the last day we were supposed to split an uber to the airport and then last minute she said there is no place for me . When i told her that is not what she said she lied to my face and said she has no idea what I am talking about and she convinced other that i must be dumb.Luckily there was another student who witnessed the entire thing and told her , i have heard it too.also she fatshames people after she lost weight.\n\nIt is like every movement of mine is either rejected ,refuted or twisted to appear as if i am in the wrong. She is multiple faced and tbh doesn’t deserve the power she is been given .",
