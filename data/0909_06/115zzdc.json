  "concern": "title: Should I feel bad about moving back?\nI’m an international student, and I got into a great R1 university for a Masters. Moved here last fall, and I graduate this spring. I have the option of applying for a PhD after I graduate while I’m on OPT here which was originally the plan. But I’ve thought about it a lot, and I think it might be better for me to move back to my home country and work in my area of interest for a bit before applying for a PhD. I already did one cycle of PhD applications before this Masters and didn’t get in anywhere for the PhD, and got the Masters instead. \n\nSince the PhD was the original plan, I really moved here thinking I won’t move back for a while. But now that I’m thinking about moving back, I’m a bit bothered by it. I love it here, I’ve made amazing friends that I go out with regularly, but I also don’t want to apply for a PhD when I’m not sure about it. I love my home country, so it’s not like I’ll hate moving back. But it’s like being stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nIs moving back home and trying again after a while okay? I keep spiralling and thinking it’s some type of failure on my part for not having figured it out. Am I screwing up my chances by moving back? Or will I screw them up worse by applying when I’m not sure? \n\nFunnily enough, I’ve been so focused on studying that I haven’t even enjoyed my move here, nor have I explored anything in the city or the country much. So all of it just seems like a bunch of missed opportunities, and i feel like I’ll be going back with almost no new experiences. \n\nI don’t know what answer I expect. But I’m mentally messed up at this point and I feel like I don’t have any options in front of me, and nothing seems worth it anymore. \n\n\nPS. Scheduled a meeting with a therapist asap. Gotta love student wellness centres.",
