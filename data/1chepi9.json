  "concern": "So I have a presentation due tomorrow and I simply do not want to do it. I am currently up late at night trying to work on it and getting frustrated. I have to present it tomorrow which makes it even worse. I just am so exhausted and just want to be done and what I have on the slides isn't complete whatsoever and missing main components. I do not want to be up all night and just want to go to sleep. I am debating if I should email my professor with an excuse or go to class and simply tell her I am not prepared. If I do email her with an excuse, she might allow me to go on Friday which in any other situation might be fine but I have a lot of work to do with it being finals week and simply would rather email her my slideshow and allow her to take points off for me not presenting it. Any ideas on what to do, what I should email her, etc. Thank you!",
