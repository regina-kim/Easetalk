Constantly I’m in classes where I struggle to apply what I’m learning and tons of kids breeze past me. I’ve done internships and I know I’m much better in the professional setting but even then I had internal hesitations when it came to technical expertise because my confidence has gone completely. Just want to finish this degree and get the hell out of here.",
