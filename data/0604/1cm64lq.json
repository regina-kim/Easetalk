  "concern": "I'm obviously grateful that I've had the chance to get an education, but my college experience was not memorable at all. I'm a science major if any of that matters.\n\n First year was completely online, which was reasonable due to the pandemic. I stayed at home and didn't dorm because it would be a waste of money if I wasn't even able to attend classes in person.\n\nSecond year was finally in-person and I tried going to many social outings and club meetings, but didn't make any friends. For a reason probably driven by Hollywood movies, I had the feeling that everyone would be cool with being friends with each other and would randomly come knocking on your door asking to hang out. I thought my roommates would become my friends, but when I moved in they didn't really want anything to do with me and our interactions solely consisted of \"hi\" and \"bye.\" Which is fine as roommates don't have to be friends.\n\nBy the end of the first month, it seemed like everyone already made their friend groups. I was getting worried by then, but people reassured me that I'll eventually find my people. Third year was basically the same as second year. I would go to outings but nobody wanted to be friends outside of the meetings. I would go to meetings, go to class, and then come back to my dorm to study. I never went out because I had no one to go with. \n\nSenior year was the year that I finally made one friend, who is my roommate. We aren't that close but that is fine. But I've been getting major FOMO because I keep seeing people taking graduation photos with their friends and talking about how college was the best 4 years of their lives and how they've made so many core memories that'll last a lifetime. For me, other than academics, I feel like the same person as I was when I first moved here.\n\nHow do I get over this?",
