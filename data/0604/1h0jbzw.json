Preparing to head to college in 2 years and planning to move out for reasons I would rather not get into/ A big concern is affordability of things in general, so I was wondering what states offer an affordable lifestyle while in college, that also allow me to live in a decent area. I've been looking at Ohio, Illinois, New Jersey and New York (state). Any help appreciated!",
