  "concern": "This is for any students who want to do research, please just ask. Ask as many profs in all the fields of work as you are willing to do. The worst they can say is no or that they are full at the moment.\n\nI am a first-year CS major who is taking a psych class for one of my specializations this semester, a very intro psych class. I always liked cognitive science, which is what this prof specialized in, so I said screw it and shot him an email explaining how, despite being a first-year and a CS major, I would love to be a hand in his work. Now, I officially started as his research assistant today and will be running trials starting next week. The key to this is to just show the prof enthusiasm about their line of work, maybe even do some research on them and mention one of their papers in your email.",
