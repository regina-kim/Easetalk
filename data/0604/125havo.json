  "concern": "I’m getting a bachelor degree in Computer Animation, which is considered STEM (I don’t code, unless problem shooting Maya and other digital art programs count). I’ve been looking into changing to a different field, something more tech/IT related. I probably won’t do four years of physical school again, so I’m considering online education. Is it better to redo the bachelors or go for a master? I’ve seen arguments from both sides, and now just looking for some advices considering my situation. \n\nThings to consider:\n1. I don’t know much about coding, the closest thing I do is node based processing like NUKE, and I don’t even know how close that is. \n2. I have roughly a month of school left before graduating with a BFA, and I’ll be working as I go to school again. \n3. I have some money saved up but not a lot\n\nAny advice is welcomed! Please let me know if there’s another subreddit I can post on that better suits the question.",

This adds to my overall uncertainty about effectively building on my current skills while managing work and education.\ntherapist: Your concern about the lack of coding experience is valid, as it can be a significant aspect of some tech fields. However, it's important to remember that not all techrelated roles require extensive coding skills, and many programs are designed to help people with diverse backgrounds make successful transitions. Have you considered looking into programs that offer a more holistic approach to technology education, including noncoding aspects like project management or user experience design?\nclient: Yes, I've considered programs that focus on broader aspects of technology, like project management or user experience design, since they might align better with my current skills and reduce the need for extensive coding. However, I'm still worried about how effectively I can integrate these into my career transition while balancing work and financial constraints.\ntherapist: Balancing work, financial constraints, and your career transition can certainly be challenging, but you're already taking steps in the right direction by considering programs that align with your current skills. Have you thought about starting with a shorter, more affordable program to get a taste of the tech field before committing to a longer or more expensive option?\nclient: Yes, I've considered starting with a shorter, more affordable program to dip into the tech field and build confidence without a major investment. However, I'm concerned about how it will align with my work schedule and limited budget while navigating this career shift.\ntherapist: Starting with a shorter, more affordable program can be a great way to test the waters and minimize risks. To address your concerns about managing your work schedule and budget, you could look into programs that offer flexible scheduling or payment options, like parttime or evening classes or financial aid for working students.\nclient: That's a helpful suggestion I'll explore programs with flexible scheduling like parttime classes to better fit my work commitments. However, I'm still concerned about ensuring that any financial aid options I find can truly accommodate my tight budget during this career transition.\ntherapist: Your concern about finding financial aid options that fit your tight budget is valid. One strategy could be to prioritize programs that offer needbased aid or scholarships specifically for career changers or working students. Additionally, some employers may offer tuition reimbursement or assistance programs that could help alleviate financial stress.\nclient: I appreciate the advice on prioritizing needbased aid and employer assistance for scholarships, as it could help with my financial challenges. However, I'm still concerned about ensuring these options align with my limited budget while balancing work and my career transition.",
