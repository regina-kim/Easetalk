  "concern": "Throughout all of my high school years, I centered my ECs around politics and advocacy as I planned on majoring in Polisci. That has changed, and now I’ll be entering my first year of college in the fall as a Computer Info Systems major. However, when I applied to college, I applied undecided since my application had little to do with tech. \n\nThe issue is, I am going to apply to transfer to a different (more competitive) school after my first semester/year, and I also intend on going to law school (and pursue data privacy law).\n\nSo, I have no idea what type of internships I should pursue and need to have this sorted before I enter college. Do I do tech related internships, legal related internships, or both? And would that look incohesive for my transfer application?",
