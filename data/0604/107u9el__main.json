  "concern": "It’s my first year in college and mid terms are coming up but I’m unable to make myself actually put in the work. In highschool i usually did the minimum to get good grades and being home a lot due to covid lockdowns i kinda lost the rhythm i had. Now i start but after a while i just do other stuff and keep procrastinating.  I find it hard because there’s no one to really tell me i should do it like in hs. How do you “force” yourself to get to work and keep at it ?",
