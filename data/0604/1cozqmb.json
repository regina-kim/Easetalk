  "concern": "Hi everyone, I am a premed student at a university that takes pride in being very stem focused. I started taking an Anatomy and Physiology class which is required for all pre-meds. This class is notoriously known to be very hard and time consuming. I had made a friend in the class, who seemed very nice, but she started showing her true colors during exam times. She is also pre-med set on being a physician. Her tests are scheduled a day after mine and she gets 5 hours on the one hour exam because she has reported her anxiety as a disability and has accommodations  (she later revealed she lied to her doctor about being anxious and just wanted extra time, and she also heard when taking these tests which are proctored, the proctors don’t really notice cheating or turn a blind eye). So after I study for the exam and barely pass, she asks me for the questions on the exam to help her cheat because she was busy hanging out with her boyfriend and didn’t have time to study. I stalled and said that’s bad and it’s the fair since the class is curved. Then the second exam comes around and she tells me how she cheats on all her exams and even has her boyfriend take her exams for her. I have since blocked her because she keeps me for the exam questions. But she found me on Instagram and is trying to be friendly with me again. It’s just very disappointing that someone like this wants to pursue a career in the medical field when education and being honest is so important. What should I do? Should I report her? ",
