  "concern": "So I started school at Lehman in 2020 fall. I got the excelsior scholarship I was good. 2022 spring I was notified half way through the semester. Not even. I found out my self that I lost the excelsior scholarship because i was missing 1 credit from the 2021 school year. By the end of 2022 I would have have 63 credits. Over the the amount of credits needed and still on my way to complete my degree.\nI tried to appeal they said no. Whole ordeal.  So now I owe 10k because of loss of scholarship. The next two years are now torture for me mentally and physically many factors. Leads to Depression. Identity stolen(ex stole messed). Family issue etc etc etc. \n\nI transferred to a community college. Taking small classes here or there paying my tuition. Took time off I think I found my passion I could get into the program I want to pursue dental hygiene. So now I transfer to Hostos community college. I can’t attend until that 10k bill is dispersed because cuny bills are all tied into 1 basically. \n\nI now here I am. I’m about to fight tooth and nails with NYS to get my scholarship shipped at least reinstated or reimbursed. But if all end fails I was wondering if there’s any grants that will cover past semester bills or am I dreaded to take out a loan \n\n\n",
