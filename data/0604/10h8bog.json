  "concern": "I am about to start my last semester of undergrad, and I am planning a graduation trip to Europe with my closest friends from high school. I finally booked a great flight that is very cheap, but my University just announced the Commencement ceremony was changed from the 20th to the 25th, and my flight is on the 23rd. Now I have to decide if i'm going to move my trip and everyone pays an extra $200+ so I can walk, or just skip the Commencement all together. This university was my last choice, but the scholarship money was good so I went there and I always regretted it. I made one really close friend, but that's about it. I honestly never grew a connection to this school or the community; I was very close to the school therapist after the passing of my brother, but the therapist no longer works at my university. For a long time I did not even want to walk at graduation, but I was going to walk anyways. Now I am stuck and I don't know what to do. Everyone I talk to makes me feel bad for wanting to go on this trip instead of trying to reschedule it to walk. I guess most people have a good college experience and think its important to, but not walking does not take away from the fact that I am still graduating and this trip is to celebrate my graduation. I just feel like i need opinions from people who have an outside perspective on it. Will i regret not walking at graduation? Is it worth changing the trip?",
