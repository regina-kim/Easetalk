  "concern": "Some colleges give students written evaluations instead of grades or in addition to grades as part of the basic transcript.\n\nIt sounds like a great idea. So I went to a college that did that. And it wasn't what I had expected.\n\nThey can say anything they want. There's very little oversight and you have little to no recourse if you disagree with something.\n\nThey can lie about you. They can make anyone look as bad as they want or as good as they want. It's completely subjective.\n\nAnd there's no way to predict what they'll say. You can get good comments on your papers and then get randomly attacked in your final evaluation for the class, the one that's part of your transcript.\n\nOne professor can have a huge impact on your future options for anything that requires a transcript just by lying about about you in an evaluation. You can wind up feeling completely slandered, thrown out like trash, and robbed of future options in life.\n\nAs great as the idea seems, I would exercise caution with colleges like that. Make sure they offer some kind of recourse when someone feels misrepresented, a way to dispute the evaluations. And look for evidence of some kind of objectivity, evidence that they won't just make personal attacks when they don't like someone. Be careful.",
