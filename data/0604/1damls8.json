  "concern": "I have sent my appeal statement and action plan to my success coach, however I would like another opinion. I will also be including a documentation along with the appeal.\n\n\n\n**~Appeal Statement~**\n\nFirst and foremost, thank you for giving me an opportunity to write an appeal statement. Despite my academic ambition, I sincerely regret not meeting the standards for the XXX. I take full responsibility for my academic performance and understand the importance of maintaining good standing.\n\nI struggled with mental health issues that significantly impacted my ability to be at my best during the previous semesters, and when I saw my grades dropping, I was made aware that I needed help. To address my issue, I started looking for a therapist, however I was put on the waiting list for a few weeks before successfully connecting with my current therapist, who referred me to get a psychiatric evaluation on the twenty-eighth of June. To improve my academic performance, I have attended time management workshops and have been in contact with my academic success coach, who has been incredibly supportive. I am also working with my therapist on improving mental health issues that resulted in my poor academic semester.\n\n**~Action Plan~**\n\nTo meet the milestones required at the end of the next evaluation period, I have created a plan that takes on a comprehensive approach.\n\n1.       After class, I will head to a study area and start working on my assignments immediately so as to prevent procrastination. Instead of heading home, I will review materials gone over in class and study at school for two hours per class before heading home and finishing any incomplete assignments and studying for another two hours per class. Rather than studying for hours on end, I will break the studying sessions in thirty-minute blocks. That way, if I need a break, I can stop, and if I do not need a break, then I can continue working.\n\n2.       I was hesitant to reach out to my professors last semester, however this semester and the upcoming semester, I will reach out and contact my professor if I am confused or need additional help on the assignments or materials.\n\n3.       XXX’s Learning Lab is a very helpful tool, so I will meet up with a tutor for each class at least once a week to help clarify and review materials that I still do not understand even after contacting the professor for help.\n\n4.       I have also created a weekly schedule planner broken into thirty-minute increments that considers every task I complete. During a time management workshop, XXX - the instructor - made me realize that my everyday tasks take up more hours than a week has, so I made a schedule where all my activities are clearly labeled and set up.",
