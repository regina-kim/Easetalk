  "concern": "I have a professor that teaches engineering statics. I took this class last semester and had to drop as I couldn’t learn fast enough to test well dispute going to private tutoring and LEAD sessions (prev students help you figure it out). \nNow i am back again and better armed. Last semester, I asked if he could post the slides before class, “No, i want it to be like exams where you go in blind.” This semester I have about 75% of the slides, because I went through 75% of the class.\nHaving slides before class are super important for my learning style (scaffolding).\nI do have a learning disorder that i am in the process of getting diagnosed so I currently cannot get any accommodations.\n\nHow do I work with professors like this who teach against my learning style and won’t help me work with it? \n\nI am not as worried about this class, but I would like to know how to handle this in the future. Also note that the process of getting my learning disorder diagnosed may take a very long time, and I CANNOT get accommodations through the school until i have the diagnosis.",
