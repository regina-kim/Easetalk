  "concern": "Hii, a few questions. I'm planning to apply to UW and Cornell and two other grad programs, but most of the deadlines are a bit difficult. \n\nFor context, my last semester as an undergrad is during the Fall 2023 semester. However, UW's Grad application deadline is on Jan 2. Would that mean I have to wait last minute to submit my application when I do finish my BA?  My university releases final exam scores on Dec. 14, so I'd be pretty 'last minute' to set out an application. Would that be an issue or make me look bad to the university?\n\nCornell's deadline is even more difficult. Their deadline is on Dec. 15. A day later for when my final scores appear on my transcript. Let's say Cornell doesn't need my GPA, could I still apply while doing my last semester as an undergrad, or would universities need the full completed transcript?",
