  "concern": "hello! i'm an undergrad studying history right now, i was previously studying physics but i changed majors. the university i am currently attending is online, very small and there aren't many history majors with actual interest in history. (most are studying it to be able to change majors later.) so i don't have a lot of people i can talk to in that regard.\n\ni was wondering if there are any groups for history majors where we can talk, share ideas, get advice, help each other and just socialize? or if anyone is interested if i were to make one? \n\nthank you for reading!",
