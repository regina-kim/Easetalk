  "concern": "Hello everybody, I\\[m18\\] am hopefully  gonna graduate highschool in 3-4 months.  I currently live in the  Netherlands, but am probably gonna attend  college in Belgium.\n\nNow, what are some good preparations to take *before* going to college abroad? Applications start in 2 months are so, so I have to be quick. I'm very anxious about moving this far at only 18. I'm sure it is the right choice, it's for a study I really like, and   studying in Belgium has lots of benefits compared to staying here. It's just that I'm still very anxious and would like everything 100%  prepared.\n\nSo, what is some good advice/tips for someone starting college abroad soon? Already thanks",
