Even though depression often pulls me back into feeling stuck, I'm hopeful that building on these strategies might make a difference in staying motivated.\ntherapist: One thing that might help is to try to really focus on the sensations and emotions you feel during those moments of relief, like the warmth of the sun on your skin during a walk, or the way the music resonates within you. By fully immersing yourself in those moments, you can create stronger memories that you can draw upon when you're feeling stuck and unmotivated.\nclient: That sounds like a helpful approach I'll try to focus more on those sensations, like the warmth of the sun, to build stronger memories for when I feel stuck. Even though depression often pulls me back into that unmotivated haze, immersing myself in those moments might offer a bit more stability amid the struggle.\ntherapist: It's great that you're willing to try this approach! Remember, the more you practice immersing yourself in those moments, the easier it might become to access those memories and feelings when you need them most. It's almost like creating a mental safety net for yourself, so you have something to hold onto when the depression tries to pull you back into that haze.\nclient: Yes, I'm eager to practice immersing myself in those moments more often, as building that mental safety net could help me cope better.

Remember, each time you practice immersing yourself in those moments, you're not just creating a safety net, but also strengthening your ability to cope with the depression. It's like building a musclethe more you use it, the stronger it becomes.\nclient: Yes, I'm motivated to keep practicing this technique, as strengthening that mental muscle could help me better handle the pull of depression when it tries to drag me down. Even though it feels challenging right now, I'm hopeful that building this coping skill will provide more lasting support amid the ongoing struggle.\ntherapist: Absolutely, and that hope is a powerful tool in itself! The more you believe in your ability to cope, the more likely you are to succeed. Remember, progress isn't always linear, but every time you practice and strengthen that mental muscle, you're taking a step in the right direction.\nclient: Thank you for the encouragement it really helps to know that hope can play such a key role in overcoming these tough feelings. I'll continue practicing and focusing on those steps forward, even when the pull of depression makes it feel so challenging.",
