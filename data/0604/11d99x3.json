  "concern": "Hi, I am Italian and I moved to Estonia last year to study for a bachelor's degree. I now have the opportunity to study for a semester in the United States (University of New Mexico) or Taiwan (National Taipei University of Technology), the only universities with which I have some courses in common. The fact is that there is a good chance that I will have to extend my bachelor's degree in the future, thus graduating a semester later. Do you guys think it's worth it considering my situation?\n\nThank you so much for your help",
