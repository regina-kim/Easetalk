  "concern": "It's my first semester being in a dorm and having a meal plan. There's multiple dining halls that anyone can go to get food. I noticed the Chick-Fil-a is the only place I've been to that has a visible screen and will say \"that is $\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\". All the other places don't say anything, no screen, no receipt, only prices listed on drinks and on shelf items (not even online menu shows prices). Only when I ask is when I know what I am paying from my meal plan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just decided to get 8 piece chicken wings and a 20oz soda just now. Last time I got that was from another dining hall and I expected to pay about $14 ($2.90 for soda \\[that's listed on the cooler and same price as other halls\\] and about $10 for the wings). The cashier charged me $22.38! I was able to see the register at this one and noticed she charged me $4.30 for the soda and $16 for the wings (that where cold). I didn't say anything then but now I am annoyed and not sure what to do here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I could, I would never get the meal plan but if I am in a dorm, I am forced to have one by policy. Do I possibly get myself in a potential argument with the cashiers (who are not student workers btw) about not charging prices advertised? I am suspecting this is normal as many students might not care and a way to get more money.",
