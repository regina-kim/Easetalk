  "concern": "hi I am currently an freshman who has an undecided major - I'm not entirely sure what I want to major in and need serious help. originally, I was going to attempt to be a CS major and I'm currently in a CS course and I can't imagine myself coding all the time for the rest of my life. I do like math, technology, and politics, and am unsure how to put all of these together in order to give myself a good shot at my career while also making the most out of my education and enjoying it. Are there any specific majors (double majors too, or minors as well) I should look into? Please help pls",
