I'm pretty sure my peers are already doing midterms.\n\nHelp, please? Any advice? I'm worried I won't know how to catch up. I'm a master procrastinator and I have debilitating ADHD, plus my meds are running out and I can't refill them right away. I'm not even good at basic taking care of myself.... Any tips? ;\\_;",
