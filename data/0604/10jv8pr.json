  "concern": "TLDR, Doing engineering, like music, want do engineering + music but unsure about costs in money and time\n\nI'm in the fourth semester of a degree in mechanical engineering and I've begun to realize that, while I really like engineering, I really love music.\n\nI'm confident that I'm good enough at playing my instrument to do really really well in the music program. I'm second chair in the university's top wind ensemble and, when I began taking clarinet lessons with the professor here, he told me that I should really seriously consider doing a double major in music performance as well as engineering (his suggestion is what kicked this whole thing off).\n\nIn an ideal world where I didn't have to worry about running out of money or time, I'd take the opportunity in a heartbeat. However, I'm already planning on taking an extra semester or two to finish my engineering degree and then after that I'm planning on pursuing a doctorate if I can get into a funded program.\n\nI don't know if it's practical to take the extra time required for the second major or degree even though it's something that I'd love to do. On the other hand, however, I really want to take the extra time to go through and do it because it would mean that I'd get a lot better at doing something that I really love.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or experience with this sort of thing?",
