And i have never thought to judge people doing their best to get a degree, especially seeing people over their 30's being the most successful they've ever been after spending their 20's in very hard places.   \n\n\ni guess my worry lies on the financial aspect and my lack of ability to believe in myself. as someone who's had to grow up with poverty looming over their family like an overexcited stalker, doing a shitty job at hiding themself, i've taken on the mental habit of instinctually thinking of the worst-case scenario, financially. i can't help it. i'm thinking of how much graduating at 27 is going to set me back, losing precious 4-5 years that i could have used getting my professional career together, instead of doing all of that when i'm 27-31 years old. this has sucked all hope and enthusiasm i have for my future and my studies.   \n\n\ni would love to hear from people who have started late or know people who have graduated late. how did it turn out for you guys?",
