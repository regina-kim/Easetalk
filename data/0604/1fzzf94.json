  "concern": "Hello,since I’m a complete idiot I ended up in a relationship very early on in college and said relationship ended up being domestically abusive. This relationship was also isolating,i’d end up missing several lectures and assignments and opportunities to become more connected with peers because i was under the control and supervision of this individual. I’m connected with the title IX and PD at my school for support,and i know i have the option to leave for mental health reasons and come back but i really don’t want to as my home life wasn’t healthy. However,no matter how much I care or how hard i try,im not doing well in school due to the trauma serving as a distraction. I got a 70 on my first criminal justice test,and a 66 on the one i got back today. Everytime i see the assignments i have to do im filled with so much dread and panic because i already feel like life is toppling down on me,having like 8 to do assignments only makes me feel more helpless and depressed. I don’t want to drop out of college at all,this is all I’ve worked towards for years now and it makes me devastated that now I’m struggling so much due to my stress being amplified by non college reasons. I really am desperately seeking any sort of advice or reaffirmation that im not completely screwed and that i can still make it through college despite this distracting setback. Thank you for reading. ",
