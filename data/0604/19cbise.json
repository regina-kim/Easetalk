Me and my dad have been planning to go visit him for the past few months and I knew I would have to miss school but it would just be during the first month and I didn’t think there would be anything big that I couldn’t make up, and there wouldn’t be another chance for me to visit him for a while. I would only miss two days of class. I have a lab on one of the days I’m missing but the two lowest lab scores are automatically dropped at the end of the course so I don’t have to worry about that. But for my math class, our first exam is on the day I will be missing. I attached the part of the syllabus that explains the rules on not being able to miss exams except for emergencies. There are only three exams total (not counting the final) and they are worth 45% of my grade. What should I say to the professor to try to convince him? I can’t cancel on the trip now",

For example, you could ask if they could give you a heads up about family events in advance, so you can plan your schoolwork around them. Do you think this could be a helpful approach?\nclient: I think offering specific suggestions to my family could be a helpful approach, as it might encourage their support in balancing my commitments without adding to the conflict. This could reduce my anxiety by making it easier to manage both my family obligations and school responsibilities effectively.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're open to trying out different strategies to communicate your needs to your family, which is great! Remember, the goal is to find a balance that works for both you and your family. As we continue brainstorming, let's also think about how you can maintain your boundaries if your family is not immediately receptive to your suggestions. How do you think you could handle that situation?\nclient: I think I could handle that situation by calmly reiterating my needs and suggesting we revisit the discussion later if needed, to avoid immediate tension. This approach might help reduce my anxiety by allowing me to stay firm on my boundaries while still showing respect for my family's perspective.\ntherapist: That's a really mature and thoughtful approach. It shows that you're committed to finding a solution that works for everyone involved. Remember, it's okay to take some time to process the conversation and revisit it later if needed.
