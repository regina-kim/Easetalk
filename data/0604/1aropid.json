  "concern": "Not really trying to elaborate on why. But to put things short, I posted a joke on my snapchat story and my roommate saw me as a threat to his safety. We have never had any sort of altercation before and were on good terms before this situation. I have been found “responsible” by the dean of students for violating 2 codes of conduct. Is it likely that I will lose my housing? The investigator told me that university housing will make a separate decision that doesn’t involve the dean of students decision. \n\nI still haven’t told my parents anything because I am holding out hope for me keeping my housing and moving past this. I believe if I lose my housing my parents will likely make me drop out as they are paying for my tuition. My brother as flunked out of college because of his grades once but never for any sort of violation of the code of conduct. If they find out about this, I likely will not be able to college again unless I pay for it myself.\n\nI’ve been stressing about this for days and it’s beginning to affect my daily life. I’ve started to skip some classes and isolating myself from my friends. All my friends in my dorm are telling me that I likely will keep my housing, but I really don’t think they are right.\n\nAnyone who has any knowledge of these types of situations or someone who has gotten their housing under review, please let me know.",
