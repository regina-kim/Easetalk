  "concern": "I’ve tried to post elsewhere but no threads let me bc it’s my first post/comment. Someone please help me. Should I go to the doctor? Do you have an explanation or a solution? This happens to my face almost every time I drink liquor. It also happens occasionally with wine or beer but not as extreme as the pic. It also happens around 8-10pm a few nights a week if I’ve had a hard day at work or am extremely exhausted. It happens occasionally in other random circumstances. But it’s almost an always a guarantee after drinking or at the end of a stressful low sleep day. What do I do? I have diagnosed social anxiety, depression, PTSD, ADHD, and autism. These disorders make me extremely scared to go to the doctor because I’m afraid of disappointing authority figures.",
