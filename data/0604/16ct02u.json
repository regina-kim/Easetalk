  "concern": "I (19m) am in my second year at a primarily commuter college and I am struggling to make any friends. Last year I was on a student FSAE team for a bit and met a few people there. However, I didn't really clique with any of them as they were they always went out drinking/partying and they gave me a lot of shit for not wanting to do it. I am simply not comfortable around alcohol.\n\nFast forward to this school year, I am no longer able to drive due me developing epilepsy. Now my brother (who also goes to the same college) drives me. The problem is the internet always says to go to events and join clubs to meet new people, but I am unable to go since my brother always wants to leave campus right away.\n\nNo-one in my classes really want to talk to each other, and people get annoyed when I have asked if I can sit at the same table as them in public spaces as I need to use an outlet that is by the table. I don't get it at all. I love talking to people, had a bunch of friends in high school despite my social anxiety. I got along with just about anybody I have talked to pre college. Sadly I don't have that many good friends anymore (Like 2 or 3 but they live hours away) and I am only feeling more lonely by the day. Any advice will be appreciated.",
