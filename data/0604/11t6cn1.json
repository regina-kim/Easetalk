  "concern": "My friend F(17) and I F (16) have been best friends since kindergarten and stuck like glue together k-7th grade. We had a falling out and both made new friends. I’m in high school now and about to go to college. We both love the same school and are planning on majoring in the same thing (I know it’s crazy how life works). Our school isn’t close to home, it’s a few hours away and I’m struggling on deciding if I want to room with her or find someone else. She is SET on rooming with me. We are still pretty close friends but not like we used to be. My hesitation is the fact that she hangs out with people I don’t align with. She smokes, parties, and doesn’t exactly prioritize school and kind of relies on me in this one class we have together. I just don’t know if i want to live with her through college but I’m also nervous I’ll regret it. She’s also a great study buddy and i love her. Please help! Should I room with my kindergarten best friend?\n\nUPDATE: \nShe really pissed me off this morning and I told her. “I can’t live with you in college” her response was I don’t really care anymore. I want to live with someone who “has fun”\nKinda hurtful because I’m not a boring person. I go to parties lol and I hangout with my friends but not until my work is done. She says she wants to be on the same floor as me but I don’t even want to do that. I also angrily mentioned her smoking and she said “yeah then you definitely shouldn’t live with me”. YALL SAVED ME. I’M FREEEE\n\nEDIT: YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!! THANK YOU FOR THE ADVICE",
