  "concern": "I’m very torn between deciding on either poli sci, anthropology, or architecture as a career path and I was therefore wondering if I complete an undergraduate degree in the EU or the UK in, for example poli sci, if I will then be able to study an M.Arch in the U.S. at a NAAB accredited institution. I know that it is possible to earn an M.Arch after having earned a U.S. bachelor’s degree in a discipline not necessarily related to architecture  and I want to know if this applies to non-U.S. degrees as well.\nThanks a lot guys and have a wonderful weekend!",
