  "concern": "This is a really niche major but would you advise for or against majoring in packaging engineering (or I guess just industrial technology). I have never been the greatest at math but at the same time never applied myself and truly put effort into it. It’s a really advanced curriculum and although I’ve always exceeded academically with low effort it’s still really intimidating. The thing is with most other majors I have absolutely no interest in and I want other options from getting a bachelors aswell (land surveying, law, med and general education for the resume). I know that the work and effort aside this is what I want but also am tempted to choose an easier major like supply chain management which I’m less interested in but has great pay and is relatively easy. Also considering taking the exact opposite route with film that I’m pretty interested in and has surprisingly good opportunities in freelance especially but pays significantly less and I don’t think I want to do this for more then a side hustle freelance. Is there any free online math course I could do to test my math skills when I give it my all? Or do you have any other advice on the major/question",
