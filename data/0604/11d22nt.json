VERY strange want, i know, but its incredibly fascinating to me. i currently go to daytona state college in daytona beach, fl, which is a glamorized (in a good way) community college. its not a bad college, but im getting my a.a. and going somewhere else, just not sure where to go that has a program i’d want. i also know i prefer macrobio over micro (shudders).\n\nim looking anywhere in the us, and i say possible premed because i know that anatomic pathology is a path i want to look into with a school (as in speaking to an advisor) to see if its the right fit.\n\nall i have right now are very general “oh that looks nice” colleges on my list like uni. of washington, uga, um ann arbor, utenn, etc. bonus points if any of the good programs are from a college that accepts more than 10%… rip",
