  "concern": "I'm currently doing Creative Writing bachelors at a university in Texas. I should be done before the Fall of 2023, but I want to transfer to Washington for my master's. I know credits transfer, but the CW degree is so different from the one I'm taking right now (different classes and courses required for the bachelor's in Washington Uni.) I was wondering if I'm going to have to do a whole different CW bachelor's degree if I do the transfer.  So, I'll have 2 CW bachelor's? But if I have the bachelor's for CW already from my university in Texas, couldn't I just jump to my Masters if I go to Washington?",
