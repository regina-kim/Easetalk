  "concern": "I signed a lease at a property which was for 2 people and 2 rooms. My friend signed the lease at the same place for a shared room which was 4 people 2 rooms.\nI am paying 400$ more monthly rent than him.\n\nWe both just got the email today which said that we both are roommates and he is the person in the other room.\nThis is a total scam because I am paying 400$ extra than what he is paying and our lease starts in august.\n\nHave any of you been in this situation? I am thinking to call a lawyer maybe and discuss this because if they can assign my friend an individual room just like that, they are probably doing it with others aswell. Any and all advice is appreciated guys. These realty companies need to pay for their wrongdoings. ",
