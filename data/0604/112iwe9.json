  "concern": "For my statistics class, we are assigned weekly a lab assignment and lab report. The time frame given is roughly 3 to 4 days. The lab report usually ending up being over 14 pages due to the intense amount of questions and their respective parts (around 8 questions with 8 parts each). These questions must include the graphs and figures that we have to code and calculate outside of the lab/class time. The code we have to show and label appropriately. \n\nThis is all too much in not enough time. To top it off, the TA is completely unaware of the lab assignment and unable to really guide us on it as she doesn't have access to it or make it. The TA, however, does grade the assignments after the due date, which is bizarre. I visit the TAs office hours every week, and she mentioned that the lab assignments seem like an outrageous amount of work. \n\nBoth my peers, TA, and I agree. However, I'm not sure how to bring this up to the professor. There is also the factor of her being brand new, so there is the possibility that she doesn't understand what workload is reasonable. \n\nAm I crazy for thinking this is too much, and how do I respectfully bring this up to her?",
