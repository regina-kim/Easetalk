  "concern": "Okay just for some context I am a senior environmental science major and I attend a fairly small school and I haven’t had much luck making friends in the 2 years since I’ve been there. The only people I have gotten close to are professors, and I often have meetings to chat and I even have a research job with one of them. Also to preface, I in no way shape or form think I am better than anybody, but I feel that from my junior to senior year I have become more confident because of all of the things I have learned in my upper level environmental classes. All my life I’ve been the girl to keep my head down and do my work and get good grades, but since last fall it was like the flip of a switch, and I all of a sudden started feeling confident enough to participate in ~some~ classes. Right now I am in a sustainability class with a professor I have taken every semester and I usually participate in class maybe once a week, and earlier this week I had a presentation and I feel like I see how much I’ve grown comfortable with speaking. I am also in a capstone class and the overarching theme of the class happens to be something I have a lot of background knowledge in from research and other classes. Every class we have a discussion but when we break into groups no one talks to me and I just participate when we reconvene and my professor asks the questions to the class. On one hand I don’t care what people think since I don’t have any friends anyways but for some reason it crosses my mind and I do get self conscious if I am just that annoying girl in class.",
