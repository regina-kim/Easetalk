  "concern": "I’m approaching my last semester before transferring into a 4-year, and can’t seem to make a decent schedule. My past 3 semesters went very smoothly ugh. My college does a M/W or T/TH, and  I’m really trying to only commute 2 days, as I’m also doing a volunteering thing at my school on Saturdays. Issue is my preferred professors all seem to teach on opposite days. i.e. Math on M/W and Accounting T/TH. They are all required courses to transfer so looks like I’m stuck going from 8am-12pm 4 days a week plus Sat, or possibly 2 days a week with questionable professors plus Sat. How do you possibly make the decision between a bad professor or a bad schedule?",
