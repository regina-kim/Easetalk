It is also timed. \n\nI had a midterm due yesterday and took after a different night class, so I’m taking this test at like 10:30 at night on my iPad. My kid isn’t feeling the hottest so I’m also cuddling and tending to him while taking this test (we are a military family with no family around us so no, no one else could watch my kid at 10:30 at night). I’m half way through my test when the low battery notification pops up in the middle of my screen and now I’m freaking out that it will look like I “got out of the test screen” because of this. \n\nDoes anyone know if that will log it in canvas as “left screen”? It was there for like maybe 30ish seconds) I feel silly for stressing this much over it, but I can’t afford to fail a midterm, especially over a low battery warning.",
