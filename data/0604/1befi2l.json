  "concern": "As the title says, I’m having trouble figuring out this dilemma. I want to get a Finance degree so I can eventually get into roles such as Asset Management, Hedge Fund, Portfolio Manager, etc. so I figured just get a no brainer Which would be a regular (Bachelors in Finance), But there are a lot of colleges that just give (Bachelors in Business Administration- Finance). Is that the same as (Bachelors in Finance)? Does it matter? I would like to major in finance and minor in statistics but I’m afraid when I see colleges mix business administration and finance together. Seems like it’ll just be a major in business admin and minor in finance. I would want finance to carry more weight in college than business admin. What’s your take?",
