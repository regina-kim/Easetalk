  "concern": "Hello, I had to leave my brick and mortar state university after I had to medically withdraw 2x for severe depression and OCD. Unfortunately the brick and mortar public state university refuses to remove the medical hold that prevents me from re-enrolling despite a letter from my doctor and proof that I just completed a year long accredited paramedic program at a tech school. I am too broke to do anything about that, despite me questioning the legality of the school doing this to me. Anyways, I know I need to advance to an actual bachelors degree because I cannot live on a paramedic salary the rest of my life (unless I do 12 + hours overtime a week or marry rich, lol.) I am considering changing fields entirely. What are some good online non-diploma mill schools? I am seeking some sort of business type degree. SNHU and Purdue Global are on guild which is paid for by the hospital I work for, but I do not want to waste my time. What is your opinion?",
