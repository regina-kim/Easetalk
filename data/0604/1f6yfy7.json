  "concern": "Pretty much the title. I feel so unlucky to be in a position where I cut off the college friend group I’ve had for so long. Like I wanted to graduate with my closest friends by my side but now that’s literally over. To make things worse my other 2 best friends from my program are gone one is taking a gap year, and the other fast tracked and graduated. I do have people to be around this year, but they’re not the ones I’m closest too :/ \n\nIs anyone else going through this or have advice on feeling better? I wish I never met those fucking bitches in the first place and invested my time into people who weren’t as jealous and pathetic as they were. \n\np.s. to anyone needing to hear this rn, (especially first years)…never dim your light for anybody. Whether it’s your intellect, your drive, your accomplishments…if I had to cut off my “friends” I would do it again in a heartbeat!",
