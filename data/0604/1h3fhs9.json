  "concern": "For context, I (19m) am currently attending my local cc with plans to be a nursing major starting next fall. My plan is to either stay at my cc to get my ADN first or transfer directly to a university to get my BSN.\n\nSo anyway, this past few months I've been struggling somewhat with some self esteem issues and FOMO. We all know that going to a cc is very different from attending a 4 year university. I actually didn't know that until a few months ago and as soon as I did I started panicking because I thought I was already having the \"college experience\" that people talk about.\n\nI have not been to a single college party since starting at my cc or done any of the fun stuff people associate with college. I have a few friends at cc but not very many and the ones I do have I don't see very often because they're majoring in different things.\n\nAdditionally, I've struggled quite a bit with my self esteem mainly in terms of my body image. This isn't by any means new for me but I do think it's gotten worse over the past few months. I was using the gym at my cc for a little bit but I eventually came to the realization that I didn't have time to workout every day. I started studying way more and my grades have improved greatly but every day by the time I've finished all my work and/or studying I feel so drained that I can't bring myself to do anything more than lay on my bed and watch YouTube.\n\nThere are other things that I've struggled with in relation to my self esteem that probably sound pretty dumb like that I'm not \"masculine\" enough or things like that.\n\nI'll admit that when all of this was at it's worst I wasn't exactly in the right mind. It was around the start of the semester and I was readjusting to taking my ADD meds again and I was very sleep deprived. It is significantly better now but it's still not great and I would like to hear about other people's experiences.",
