  "concern": "I'm a rising senior in math looking for research opportunities in machine learning (with a focus on theory). I contacted a professor in June, but I was committed to another project at the time. He briefly mentioned his research interests but advised me to focus on my current work. My previous commitment is over now, and I reached out to him last Saturday, but I haven't received a reply yet. I'm planning to send a follow-up email but I'm really afraid of screwing this up because he's the only professor at my university whose research truly interests me. I would appreciate any suggestions. Here's my email (transcripts attached):\n\nDear Professor \\[name\\],\n\nI’m writing this follow-up email to express my strong interest in your research and to inquire whether there are undergraduate research opportunities with you.\n\nI tried to explore the \\[research direction\\] you mentioned in your previous email. I thought you might be referring to \\[paper\\] and the subsequent line of work. I’m currently reading the related papers, and I’m very interested in any potential extensions of this idea.\n\nI reproduced GPT-2 from scratch and some results in in-context learning to familiarize myself with the related code. I have a solid background in mathematics and statistics, with PhD-level coursework in real analysis and probability theory, as well as knowledge in learning theory through my previous research work \\[linked paper\\] in RL theory. I am also always eager to learn new concepts and techniques.\n\nYour work in transformers and LLMs is really intriguing to me, and I would greatly appreciate any potential research opportunities with you.\n\nI will be enrolling in only two required courses in the next academic year, and I will be able to commit fully to research with you. I would truly appreciate any research opportunity you could offer, and I’m very willing to discuss further my qualifications and any related research ideas you might have.\n\nI look forward to hearing back from you. Thank you.\n\nBest regards,\n\n\\[Name\\]",
