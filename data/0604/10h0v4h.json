  "concern": "I’m currently studying with a bachelors degree in architecture and my schedule goes from 8 am / 8:30 am until 6:30 pm everyday from monday to friday. We only have a 9:30 am to 11:30 class on Saturday. I was wondering if there’s others who are just like me. I can’t even fathom how it would be possible for me to survive long hours in college. \n\nAdditional context (?): I live 1-2 hours away from my school and would sometimes need 3-4 hours extra for commute. That would mean that I need to be awake at 5 am to get ready for school and arrive in school at 8 am. Then be in class until 6:30 pm. Then hopefully arrive home sometime between 8-9 pm. Which honestly just sounds terrifying that by then I’ll have 8 hours remaining left and I would still need to study and do extra plates. Any advice?\n\nEdit to clarify: 7:30 am to 4:00 pm is usually the normal school schedule here in our country starting from elementary. By high school our schedule becomes 7:30 to 5:30 pm. Just wanted to input this here since there seems to be a lot of comments about how a 10 hour schedule each day is allowed",
