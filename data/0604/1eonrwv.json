  "concern": "hi! i recently switched out of my education program because I realized teaching isn't for me after spending time in the classroom. my true passions lie in music/singing, movies/TV shows, and photography—these are my biggest hobbies and where I focus most of my energy (aside from shopping for clothes lol). i also love using social media to craft a specific message through my account style (such as what images I post, the colors i use, casual or professional, etc.), i'm really interested in brand imaging, design, problem-solving, bias/data implications, researching solutions, communicating with a team but having independent flexibility, really enjoy using technology such as my laptop, and good career income potential.\n\ni've narrowed down some programs at my university that i think would be a good fit, but i'm curious to hear what others suggest on how to combine them to best leverage my interests and career prospects. thanks in advance for your advice!\n\n**here are the programs I'm considering:**\n\n* Business Administration: Marketing (major)\n* Marketing (minor)\n* Business Entertainment (major or minor)\n* Communication Studies (major)\n* Communications (minor)\n* Film and Media Arts (major)\n* Journalism (major)\n* Public Relations & Strategic Communication (major)\n* Sociology (major or minor)",
