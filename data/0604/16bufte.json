  "concern": "Ok so i initially went to college for only a semester and had a pretty nasty mental breakdown and took a much needed break. But I’m ready to go back, and I tried applying for the local college in my area but when I tried to give my transcripts from when I went to college, the og college I went to blocked me from getting said transcripts cause I was in too much debt (4,600 usd) and they told me i had to pay off 3500 usd for them to release my transcripts. Even though I have two jobs and work 40+ hours, there is no way in hell I’m going to pay that off anytime soon. So, would I get into trouble if I did not put down my original college semester. I just want to go back to school, before I lose hope in myself.",
