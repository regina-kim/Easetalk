  "concern": "I am taking four classes this semester. Intro to Math, Com 225 (public speaking), EDU 222, and a history class. The first three are in person but the history class is online only. I like my new schedule and my new classes, the EDU class does not start for a few more weeks though so I have some down time. I really want to focus this semester and get A's or B's in all my classes. I am kind of worried about Math because I am not very good at it so we will see. I am really excited about the EDU class because I can see all my old friends from last semester and the teacher is probably the best teacher I have ever had! Lets do this!",
