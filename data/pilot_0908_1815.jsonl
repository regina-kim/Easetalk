Until this week, I had been at my parents' house doing online school from there. While I'm definitely not the biggest proponent of online school, I was actually really enjoying life at home. I got to focus on doing readings and work without worrying about maintaining my own living space, I didn't have a commute to and from classes, and I really enjoyed hanging out with my family every day. Now I'm in a different city which is still pretty shut down from the pandemic, living alone, I can't see anyone, I haven't been able to focus on my coursework that much, and I just feel really *lonely* especially since the people in my cohort aren't keen on getting together due to the pandemic. Even though I absolutely love my program and what I'm studying, I'm starting to question if it's worth the lifestyle choices that are necessary (e.g., moving away from home, the job search being global rather than local). Now, I'm finding myself wishing the weeks would pass until I can go back during the break. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way and how they cope with it. I'm also wondering if moving away for grad school is that much better if there weren't a pandemic shutting everything down\/limiting any social activities; especially since so many people refer to grad school as an isolating experience anyway.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello!

{"id":"119bwqj","timestamp":1677024000000,"category":"school_life","concern":"I graduated college less than a year ago (May 2022); and my undergraduate experience was already screwed up by COVID-19 - I was forced to skip out on a full year before returning to Senior year because the US did not allow international students to take hybrid classes and my university was not offering at least 3 in-person classes for me during the 2020 - 2021 lockdown. So I got to watch all my friends graduate without me; I did qualify for an accelerated Master's Program in Economics and I was accepted but I opted not to pursue it due to COVID-19 and feeling that I did not want to stay in Fordham for both undergraduate and graduate school.  \n\n\nAnyway, I somehow managed to get a short-term contract at the World Bank since they hired people from around the world, and if I work for the World Bank in a full-time job for about 15 years I am eligible for permanent residency (green card). For all intents and purposes I really want to stay and live and build a life in the US (especially now with geopolitical events in SE Asia). The problem is that I don't have options for employment in the private sector because the H1-b process is absurdly random and difficult; and the World Bank and IMF have outright told me that I can't get a fulltime job without AT LEAST a Master's Degree (it's already brutally difficult for me to get even a short-term contract role, let alone a fulltime job); and even this employment is not guaranteed.  \n\n\nI'm thinking of getting a Master's Degree in Statistics or Data Science (an MBA or Master's degree in economics isn't very helpful) but I have checked that I did not take enough undergrad courses in Math or Computer Science to qualify (at least in the US). I'm fairly certain that my math skills and coding skills are nowhere near good enough for grad school (I struggled for a 3.60 gpa even before COVID-19)  \nI'm honestly totally lost because I'm being forced to prepare for grad school so soon, just after I managed to find something solid career-wise (I'm 23 turning 24). Otherwise I have to go back to the Philippines and I probably won't have an opportunity to immigrate elsewhere anymore.  \n\n\nAny advice for my circumstances?","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hi there!
