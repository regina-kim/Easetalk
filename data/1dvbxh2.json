  "concern": "Hello everyone, I've been wondering for a bit of time if I should take a gap year or not, here's my perspective on it.\n\nI am 18M and just over 3 months ago in Poland, the school year has ended, and two months ago I finished all my maturas. Now it's July and with seemingly little time left until September 30 - the start of the academic year, I'm still confused on what I want to do in college and if I want to go to college at all this year.\n\nI come from a - without overexaggeration or underplaying it, a broken, poverty stricken home, I've graduated high school and completed the optional matura from two extended subjects - Polish and History. Therefore it should be no surprise I wish to major in something related to humanities, but so far, I have yet to apply to college or go to work, and now I'm wondering, is it too late? I should mention that I have an older brother that would be willing to help me get a job in Germany, where of course I'd be paid in euros, a currency stronger than the zloty. Should I simply take a gap year and focus on work, developing skills and maybe making some connections, or should I lock in and apply to college, go to work for a bit and focus on my degree? And if so, what would be a good major for me? I'm obviously looking for something in humanities that would also have some creativity required, perhaps journalism? A good pay with plenty of internship opportunities and vacant job spots would be great, too.",
