  "concern": "Hi. This post is just gonna be me venting/asking for thoughts? \n\nI started college at 17 and now I am graduating with a Biology degree. I graduate in 2 months. College really has not been fun for me. I've struggled a lot with my grades, mental health, friends, financially, etc. I have not had a car throughout college. Most of my days have been spent on campus and not being able to go out. Most of the \"fun\" times I have had in college involved substance abuse. I had a friend group in my junior year and we would just get drunk and go to parties. I got assaulted twice at a party. After that, I distanced myself from the group and stopped going out. Now, its my second semester of my senior year. All of senior year, I have not had any friends and spent September-now alone. My best friend lives a few hours away and goes to another school and we talk everyday. However, I dont have anyone on campus to hang out with. I am looking forward to my life after college. I will be financially independent, have a car, an apartment and have the freedom I have been craving. I wont have to rely on my parents financially and can really be an adult. I already have a few companies ready to hire me. I just want it to be April so badly so I can graduate and move on to the next chapter of my life. I feel depressed when I have to go to class still and do assignments. I know I sound whiny and dumb. But I am so deeply burnt out from school and everything I've gone through. I am still passing all my classes and managing fine. But everyday feels the same and I just have urges to self destruct. I want to go back to substance abuse to cope with my feelings. But I know if I do that, my grades will suffer, and I dont want to fuck up when Im so close to graduating. I dont really feel excited about graduating and it doesnt feel real. I keep feeling like something will randomly happen that stops me from graduating. I wish I could just calm down and ride out these last 2 months and be happy about this huge accomplishment. My parents are so happy and proud of me. I dont understand whats wrong with me and why I cant just be happy for myself. I also feel like I am not ready to be an actual adult because I have not had that many real-life experiences.",
