{"id":"seeu31","timestamp":1643328000000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"I'm in a MA program right now and we just started in-person learning. Until this week, I had been at my parents' house doing online school from there. While I'm definitely not the biggest proponent of online school, I was actually really enjoying life at home. I got to focus on doing readings and work without worrying about maintaining my own living space, I didn't have a commute to and from classes, and I really enjoyed hanging out with my family every day. Now I'm in a different city which is still pretty shut down from the pandemic, living alone, I can't see anyone, I haven't been able to focus on my coursework that much, and I just feel really *lonely* especially since the people in my cohort aren't keen on getting together due to the pandemic. Even though I absolutely love my program and what I'm studying, I'm starting to question if it's worth the lifestyle choices that are necessary (e.g., moving away from home, the job search being global rather than local). Now, I'm finding myself wishing the weeks would pass until I can go back during the break. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way and how they cope with it. I'm also wondering if moving away for grad school is that much better if there weren't a pandemic shutting everything down\/limiting any social activities; especially since so many people refer to grad school as an isolating experience anyway.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello!

Feel free to share whatever's on your mind or any concerns you might have.\nclient: Hey, thanks. I guess I'm just feeling overwhelmed with everything. It feels like I’m constantly working and even when I’m not, I’m just too drained to enjoy my free time.\ntherapist: It must be really tough to feel constantly drained. Can you tell me more about what's been overwhelming you?\nclient: Honestly, it's just this constant cycle of work. My PhD program is super demanding, and it feels like there's never any real break.\ntherapist: It sounds like your PhD program is taking up a lot of your time and energy, leaving you with little room to recharge. How do you typically spend your time when you're not working on your program?\nclient: Lately, I've been trying to squeeze in some downtime, but it usually ends up being just me catching up on sleep or aimlessly scrolling online. I used to hit the gym or hang out with friends, but now it's like I don’t have the energy for it anymore.\ntherapist: That sounds challenging, especially since you used to enjoy activities like going to the gym and spending time with friends. It seems like the demands of your program are leaving you with less energy for the things you once loved. What was it about those activities that you found fulfilling or enjoyable?\nclient: I think it was just a nice break from everything, you know? Going to the gym made me feel good physically, and hanging out with friends was a way to just relax and have fun without thinking about work. It was like hitting a reset button, which I really miss.\ntherapist: Taking a break and recharging through activities you enjoy sounds like it was really important for your well-being. Considering how much you miss that reset, how do you think your life might change if you could reintroduce these activities, even in small ways?\nclient: I think even a little bit of time for myself would make a big difference. It might help me feel more balanced and less like I'm constantly just grinding away without a break.\ntherapist: Reintroducing even a small amount of time for yourself could indeed help you regain some balance. What might be a first small step towards bringing back these activities that help you feel recharged?\nclient: Maybe I could start by setting aside just 20 minutes a day to do something for myself, like a short workout or a quick catch-up with a friend. It doesn’t sound like much, but it might be a good start to feel a bit more like myself again.\ntherapist: Starting with just 20 minutes a day to focus on yourself sounds like a meaningful step toward regaining some balance. How confident do you feel, on a scale from 0 to 10, about being able to make this happen?\nclient: client: I’d say maybe a 6 or 7. I’m hopeful, but it's hard to predict if I'll stick to it with everything going on. I guess I just need to try and see how it goes.\ntherapist: A confidence level of 6 or 7 shows a good amount of hope and readiness to try. What aspects of your life do you believe could help you increase that confidence even further?\nclient: I think having a bit more structure and maybe even accountability could help. If I could buddy up with a friend for workouts or set specific times for breaks, it might make it easier to stick to.\ntherapist: Teaming up with a friend or setting specific times sounds like a proactive way to build structure and accountability. Would you like to explore creating a schedule or finding a workout buddy as your next step?\nclient: Yeah, I think creating a schedule could be really helpful. Having a plan to follow might make it feel less chaotic, and if I can find a workout buddy, that’d be a bonus for motivation.\ntherapist: Creating a schedule sounds like a solid plan to help bring more order and motivation into your routine. What might your schedule look like? Perhaps you could start with small, manageable steps, or do you have other ideas in mind for getting started?\nclient: client: I guess I’d start by blocking out time for the essentials like classes and lab work. Then I’d set aside some time for exercise and relaxation. It’s hard to fit everything in, but maybe just having a rough outline could help me balance things better.\ntherapist: Having a rough outline seems like a practical way to ensure balance while allowing flexibility. What specific steps would you like to take to put this schedule into action, and how can we anticipate any challenges you might face in sticking to it?\nclient: I think I'll start by writing down my weekly commitments and then slot in time for workouts and breaks around them. A challenge might be sticking to it when unexpected tasks pop up or if my PI demands more time, but maybe I can adjust as needed without losing sight of my main priorities.\ntherapist: Writing down your weekly commitments and then fitting in workouts and breaks sounds like a thoughtful approach. What do you think could be your first step in creating this schedule, and would it help to brainstorm some strategies for handling unexpected tasks?\nclient: I suppose my first step would be sitting down and actually writing everything out, maybe on a Sunday evening to plan for the week ahead. Yeah, brainstorming strategies would be great; it'd be nice to have a few backup plans for when things don't go as expected.\ntherapist: Planning out your week on Sunday evening sounds like a proactive first step. To brainstorm strategies, you might consider options like allocating buffer time in your schedule for unexpected tasks or prioritizing tasks when something urgent arises. How do these options resonate with you, or do you have other ideas you'd like to explore?\nclient: Yeah, I think having buffer time built into my schedule sounds smart. That way if something unexpected comes up, I won’t be thrown off completely. Prioritizing tasks is something I need to get better at, though I'm not sure how to decide what's truly urgent sometimes.\ntherapist: Deciding what's urgent can be tricky, and acknowledging the need to improve in that area shows great self-awareness.

I've been thinking a lot about changing my last name, and it's been stressing me out a bit, especially with my PhD defense coming up and the work I've put into networking.\ntherapist: Changing your last name feels daunting because of your upcoming PhD defense and all the networking you've done. What aspects of this change are weighing on you the most?\nclient: I guess I'm mostly worried about losing the professional connections I've built and how it'll affect my academic presence. It feels like starting from scratch in some ways.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're concerned about the potential impact on your professional identity and the hard work you've invested. What does your current professional presence mean to you?\nclient: I think it's kind of like my academic footprint, you know? It's everything I've built up to now, and I'm worried that changing my name might erase some of that recognition.\ntherapist: You're feeling anxious about the idea of altering your academic footprint because it's a significant part of your identity and recognition. What does having this recognition mean for you personally and professionally?\nclient: I think it gives me a sense of validation, like all those years of work have paid off and I belong in the academic community. It's also a way of feeling connected to others in my field, like they know who I am and what I can do.\ntherapist: Your recognition as part of the academic community seems to offer both validation and a sense of belonging. How do you envision maintaining that connection and validation if you decide to change your name?\nclient: Honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to maintain those connections. Maybe by reaching out personally to people I've worked with and updating them about the change? But at the same time, it feels like I might still lose some recognition with those who only know me by my current name.\ntherapist: Maintaining those connections seems important to you, and personal outreach could be a meaningful step. How do you feel about the idea of reaching out personally, and are there other ways you might reinforce your academic identity if you decide to change your name?\nclient: I think reaching out personally could be a good way to keep those connections strong, but it also feels a bit daunting, like I might have to reintroduce myself or prove my identity all over again. I'm also considering other ways, like updating my online profiles and maybe even co-authoring papers under both names for a while to bridge the gap.\ntherapist: Balancing the desire for consistency with the potential changes sounds complex. How might these strategies, like co-authoring under both names, help ease your transition and maintain your academic identity?\nclient: Co-authoring under both names might help create a link between my old and new identities, easing the transition for colleagues and collaborators. It feels like a way to keep my work recognizable while I navigate this personal change.\ntherapist: Creating that link between your old and new identities seems to offer a reassuring sense of continuity. How do you see this strategy informing your sense of identity and confidence in moving forward with the change?\nclient: I think it could definitely help me feel more secure in my decision, knowing that I'm not completely starting over professionally. It's like having a safety net as I make this transition, so I feel more confident about moving forward with it.\ntherapist: It’s great to hear that these strategies are helping to build your confidence and provide a sense of security. In moving forward, would you like to explore specific steps to implement these ideas, like setting up a timeline for updating your profiles or beginning a co-authoring project? Or do you feel there’s another area you’d like to focus on as you plan this transition?\nclient: I think mapping out some clear steps could be really helpful, especially with everything else going on. Maybe starting with updating my online profiles and reaching out to key contacts in a focused way would be a good start.\ntherapist: Creating a plan to update your online profiles and reach out to key contacts sounds like a proactive start. Which step do you feel ready to tackle first, and are there any potential challenges you foresee with these actions?\nclient: I think updating my online profiles is something I could start with soon, but I'm a little worried about how people will react to the name change. It's hard to predict how smoothly that will go, but it's probably a necessary first step.\ntherapist: Acknowledging your feelings about the name change is important, and it's understandable to have some concerns about others' reactions. You've identified updating your online profiles as a necessary first step, and you've already shown resilience by planning this transition. As you move forward, remember to give yourself grace during this process and perhaps prepare a brief explanation to help ease any conversations that arise. \n\nStarting with small, manageable tasks like these can build momentum and confidence, which is a great way to approach change. Remember, you're not alone in this; reaching out to key contacts can provide additional support and encouragement. As you take these steps, stay mindful of your own pace and comfort level. \n\nYou’re making thoughtful and intentional decisions, and that’s commendable. If any challenges arise, know that support is available, and you can always revisit your plan to adjust as needed. I look forward to hearing about your progress and continuing to support you on this journey. Take care and remember, each step forward is a step towards your goals.\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate your support as I navigate this. I'll focus on updating my profiles and try to handle it one step at a time.","completed":false}
