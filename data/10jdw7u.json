(I’ll describe a situation that happened recently.)\n\nI’m writing a paper on endangered languages, and I’m including the Irish language in it. I want to write about the history of Ireland, and I already know some stuff about it without having to look it up (for example, Ireland became a “free state” in 1922). \n\nTechnically, I haven’t consulted any sources to know that fact; I knew it before I started writing the paper. However, it’s obviously not a conclusion of mine or a new fact I have found, and it’s not something that’s “common knowledge” of the topic I’m writing about.\n\nAm I expected to cite a source that states the fact (for example, an encyclopaedia) or not? (I’m not asking about whether I should, but about whether it’s an EXPECTATION that there will be a citation for facts that I know without looking them up.)",
