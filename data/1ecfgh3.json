  "concern": "So, I'm in highschool right now, and I want to learn some things (i.e linear algebra, maybe some other math courses). However, I can't really afford to pay for dual enrollment, and so, I figured I could just self-study or use MIT's Opencourseware for courses or something like that. But, I honestly don't want to take these courses again in college. Do most colleges require that I have to take for-credit courses or am I allowed to take a placement test or something? I also do competitive physics classes, and even though it's technically college level, it isn't for credit either; am I also able to take placement tests for that too?",
