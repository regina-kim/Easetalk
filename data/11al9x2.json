  "concern": "Hi guys,\n\nI am not sure if this is the right place to post this but I really wanted to share. I had a little win today. Thereâ€™s this class that I really like and the professor and I have had this unspoken friendship all semester. I participate in class and they always smile at me but we never formally met because I was petrified to show up to office hours. The thought of making conversation and awkward silences makes me wanna crawl under a blanket and never come out.\n\nToday, however, I pushed myself to show up. I was literally standing outside the room for 10 minutes pacing back and forth. I looked crazy but I eventually found the courage to walk in there. I ended up having a great conversation with my professor and they expressed how they were glad that I showed up. It wasnâ€™t nearly as scary as I made it out to be in my head and, get this, I kinda want to go back some day.\n\nCelebrating this small victory in hopes that anyone who struggles with this too will feel encouraged to take that step. ðŸ«¶",
