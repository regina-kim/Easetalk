  "concern": "I live on campus at a school in NYC, and there’s a specific security guard I pass every Sunday when I leave for church. I’m disabled and use a very distinctive/unusual mobility device, so he knows me on sight; I always say good morning and he responds with a bit of small talk, asks how my classes are, how my family is back home, things like that, and then I go on my way to church and he always says “welcome back” or something like that when I come back to campus. This has been an ongoing thing for three weeks now and it’s honestly one of the things I look forward to most on Sunday mornings. I make a habit of saying “good morning” and such to the custodians and security guards, but he’s the only one who really responds and seems to know me. Would it be weird if I asked him his name? I don’t want it to come off like I’m being creepy or hitting on him or anything, since he’s middle-aged and I’m a female college student, but I really do look forward to that brief small talk and I’d like to be able to say hello by name. Is there a non-weird way to go about this?",
