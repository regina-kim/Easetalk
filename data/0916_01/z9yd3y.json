The only problem is that screenwriting is impossibly hard to break into and not very consistent money so I don’t plan on getting a degree in it. What kind of degree should I take on so I can hold a steady job that’ll let me be able to afford living while writing on the side? Please no STEM recommendations my math and science grades throughout high school hovered around high C’s.",
