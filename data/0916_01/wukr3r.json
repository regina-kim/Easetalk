Setting small, achievable goals like attending one extra event per week or spending an hour in the student center can make a significant difference. \n\nRemember, building connections takes time, and every step forward, no matter how small it might seem, is progress. If you feel comfortable, consider inviting a classmate or club member to join you for coffee or study together. Sometimes, those one-on-one interactions can lead to deeper connections.\n\nAs you move forward, know that I'm here to support you in this journey of creating a fulfilling college experience.
