  "concern": "title: I need advice on dropping out, please help\nSo my dad just got approved for ssdi, I (18 F) qualify for $900 a month if I'm at least part time enrolled in school. Well, it took my dad a long time to get approved so I thought that once he got approved I could apply to a college and then start getting money pretty quick. Apparently thats not how it works, my dad has to get processed too. Now because no one told me that, (only how he had been accepted after waiting like a year or two already) and I was being pressured to start college for other reasons, I started looking at potential colleges. My grandmother found a pretty nice one and texted me one day to come over to her house and we would look at the school and see how we like it. Well when I got there she already had all the information typed out on the application form for a degree I never wanted in the first place. If it were up to me, I wouldn't have even gone to school in the first place. But it wasn't, I knew how much it meant to my other grandmother (I will be referring to her as Nana). I had already decided that with the \"free money\" (I say that very lightly lol) and my Nanas eagerness for me to start school, that I would do it, I just wanted to wait a little bit. Well, I thought I had mentioned my unwillingness enough times to stick. I already have a few job offers I could take for the summer this year if I really wanted to. Anyway, I asked my grandmother if I had to do this. She told me I had too. So obviously I thought her and Nana had talked it out and they determined I had to start right away, which was the only reason why I caved in. So I accepted and she called Nana and they paid. When I got home that night, my Nana and Dada (primary caregivers/parental figures) asked me if this is what I wanted. I told them this: \"No, but it's something I have to do\" referring back to what my grandmother had said previously. Well, here I am a few days later and I just now got off the phone with my Nana who told me she had no idea and that she was never gonna force me to go to college, as well as it would take until the end of the year most likely before I would receive the ssdi benefits and none of which would include money I would have made if I was getting paid as soon as I started school. So now I'm at a crossroads, I never wanted to start school in the first place because I was scared I would give up halfway through or change my mind and switch majors. I wanted to wait and plan everything out and not jump right in. I jumped right into work right after high school and worked myself sick, I didn't wanna repeat that. Tomorrow i think, is the deadline to ask for our money back. I don't wanna be labeled a college dropout. The mere thought of it makes me want to cry tbh. I know that this is mostly my fault for not checking in with both parties. Most of the time they do consult each other about my school so I just assumed they both knew everything. Now I have no idea what to do, I have less than 24 hours to figure out if I drop out and get the money back, or switch majors which will still leave me with the same issue because I have no idea what I want to do. I'm open to hear what literally anyone has to say.",
