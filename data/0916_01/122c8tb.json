I would love to go to any of those but after a conversation with my parents I’m starting to consider community as I also have 3 other siblings and my parents don’t know if they can pay for all of us. We get no financial aid because my parents make good money and I plan on attending graduate school. I’m so torn between it, I want to get the freshman experience and leave town but I don’t know if I’ll ever forgive myself for my parents being in debt or my siblings not being able to attend college. Can you guys just give me your thoughts?",
