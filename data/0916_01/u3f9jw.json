I'm a Freshman engineering student just for context. \n\nI work hard and put so much time for college which may seem perfect. However, I'm always late in classes and midterms come while there is a ton I still have to study. Its exhausting because I dont get time to have fun and spend with my family. What's making me tired is what I achieve compared to the time and effort I put. \n\nI want to enjoy college and life and have the opportunity to finally understand what I'm learning not only for tests. Now that midterms are over, I'm looking for a new approach for college so I dont repeat the loop all over again.\n\nI'm very excited to hear your tips and thoughts.\n\nThings to put in consideration is that I'm a commuter. Commute to and back from college take about 2.5~3 hours daily + making me tired. Note, next year's commute is gonna be way shorter due to change of campus.",
