  "concern": "title: Anyone using Aleks math? What are your thoughts on it? (Story)\nThe concept makes sense, but it is repetitive. All three of my math professors have used aleks due to blended classes. So students Aleks are different from each other. This professor was more annoying due to her giving us so much damn work, I was doing more math than any of my other class work for other classes. My professor once thought it was a good idea to give us 74 topics once, but in a span of two weeks so there was sometime to it. I lost my mind and got up to 53. I ended up passing the class. \n\nThe second one, I did fine in the first half and the topics were a lot less compared to the first class, but I started to be in a deep burnout state and even getting COVID that I gave up and failed the class due to constantly completing Aleks and just saying fuck all to any topics and assignments.\n\nNow my third professor and I’m making up the class. I’ve somewhat came up with a better system to complete them: on average, it’s 24 topics due in a span of 3-4 days. Of those three days, I complete six topics a day. I’m still in that system. Slipped a bit because I have to put my attention to two other classes and somewhat procrastinated. But now I’ve realized I’ve put so much time in Aleks, I’m somewhat behind in other classes. And I wanted to try and enjoy my weekend whilst maintaining Aleks and I’m seeing a module that is due March 5 of next month that I haven’t touched due to me working on the current module (which I have 33 topics remaining out of 140 I think so I’ve been doing good). \n\nAnd I have to work this weekend, but it looks like I may have to call out both days to maintain Aleks and other class work. Which is already bad because I haven’t been working as much recently. \n\nSo now I’m just frustrated and confused on my options because Aleks is taking up too much of my time). And I’m not kidding when I say I have had full on panic attacks due to trying to complete Aleks to pass the class with a C or above. Anyone else?",
