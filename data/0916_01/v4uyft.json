  "concern": "title: Grad school or Gap Year Abroad?\nMy main question is pretty obvious from the title, but I’ll give a little more context here. \n\nI’m about to graduate from undergrad with a BSE in English. I’m also completing a senior thesis and getting certified to teach middle through high school English. Right now I’m looking through graduate schools, prepping for the GRE, and working on thesis, but the more I look into the programs I’m interested in, the more I’m realizing I will likely not be accepted. \n\nThe biggest reason is the language requirement. Most of the programs require fluency in another language upon entry. However, others require it by the end of the first year, meaning you’ll have to start at an intermediate level upon entry. I was originally minoring in Spanish, but for many reasons I won’t go into, I had to drop it. I picked up a Writing Studies minor instead, but now looking at Graduate programs in Comparative Literature/Cultural Studies/etc. that I’m interested in, I know I should’ve gotten that minor in Spanish. However, I don’t have space in my schedule to make up all those credits in my last year. I also can’t afford summer classes. For the few programs that don’t require you to come in fluent, I’d technically only need one other Spanish class to meet their requirements. \n\nHowever to top it all off, I’d actually prefer to learn a different language. I would still love to learn Spanish at some point, but my undergrad thesis is focused on Chinese American literature. I’d prefer to focus the rest of my graduate studies on that field. My university only offers French and Spanish, so I’m out of luck there. \n\nThis brings me to my question. Should I apply for graduate programs, cramming in some beginning Chinese program during the summer through CIEE or something similar through my university’s study abroad to bring me to the bare minimum intermediate level? Or should I take a gap year studying abroad to gain a much higher level of fluency, take a break, and give myself more time to consider all my options? I’m afraid of what Graduate admissions will think if I take a year off, and there’s always the possibility that I won’t be accepted or be able to afford a year studying abroad. It could end up being thousands of dollars in debt wasted when I should’ve just gone straight into grad school. \n\nAny advice is welcome. Even if you think I should suck it up and just take the Spanish course!",
