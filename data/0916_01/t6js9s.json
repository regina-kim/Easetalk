What resonates with you about these options, or would you like to consider something else?\n\nLet’s wrap up by setting a clear next step. Perhaps this week, you could start by experimenting with flexible study blocks and buffer times. Maybe try using a timer and see which stress-relief technique fits best for you. Remember, it's all about finding what works naturally for you. You're doing great by taking this step. I'm here to support you, and we can review your progress and any adjustments next time.

  "concern": "title: How are you all able to manage everything you're doing? 😩\nSo for context, I'm not a grad student yet but I'm a senior undergrad who's taking 4 grad level courses, along with doing a research project and a TA-ship. Posting here because I think this is the same (probably still less) workload as most of you have and I genuinely don't know how to manage everything. And thinking about this is making me fearful of what's going to happen when I start grad school myself. \n\nAnyway, I'm a first time TA, and I started this out by being super energetic and responsive to students, and this is a class of 260 kids with 4 TA's in total for it. I'm the head TA, so along with dealing with student questions and grading and stuff, plus holding weekly office hours and practice sessions, I'm handling most of the managerial tasks along with it like maintaining data for everything along with organizing stuff and continuing to email the class about any and all updates about anything. Because of this, most students contact me when they have an issue, and obviously I'm going to respond to their emails, and I have to make sure they understand stuff, because this is a calc-1 class with a majority of non-stem students. I've even been setting up extra zoom meetings with some of them, which have ranged from anywhere between 30 minutes to 1.5 hours. \n\nThe problem with this is. I can't find time to do anything else. I haven't been focusing on my courses at all, and I have a midterm in about 14 hours that I haven't even begun to study for. I have two more midterms in the next week, and again, no idea how I'm going to deal with them. The most I do is complete assignments, but some of them can easily take anywhere between 2 days, to a week (the latter for a very difficult pure math class). I also need to complete, or at least continue my senior year research project, but I haven't done anything with it for nearly a month now. I genuinely just can NOT find time for anything. And that's especially if I'm trying to make sure I have a good sleep schedule (nothing extreme, but at least 5-6 hours every night) along with maybe taking out an hour or two for myself in a day (which includes time taken to eat or nap mostly). \n\nI just genuinely need advice. How do you handle everything, alongside doing justice to each of your responsibilities and NOT overburdening yourself to the point of complete burnout? Do you set up schedules? I'm really sorry for posting here, but I have no idea where/who else to ask and I'm seriously going to end up completely incapable of doing anything if it continues like this.",
