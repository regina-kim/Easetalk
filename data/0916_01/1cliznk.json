  "concern": "title: Should I take a gap year? I already have Jr. Dev job\nI am about to graduate with an Associates of Applied Science in Multimedia and Web Development in a couple weeks. Not the best degree choice considering the market. When I first started my degree my goal was to become a front-end web developer, but that was in 2021 and it seems most companies are looking for full-stack.\n\nI am graduating with highest honors with a 4.0 GPA, woo! I have won some awesome awards like \"Student of the year\" just last month out of all the people going for business, technology, and workforce readiness degrees. I was in Phi Theta Kappa, and was a chapter officer.\n\nI am tired. I worked a full time job through this entire school trip and I am genuinely tired.\n\nHere is the thing, I already have a Jr Software Developer position. I started a couple months ago. I got this job due to an internal promotion, I was already at this company as a lead IT technician, and I networked the hell out of the developers and they finally took me in. I live an hour from my work so I spend a good 10 hours a day just with work and commuting, it has been really rough this last semester but I am making it.\n\nI want to take a break. I got the jr dev job. I want a break. I am so mentally exhausted. But the doom scrolling on reddit scares me. I had people tell me I only got lucky and it won't be so easy next time I get a job (this wasn't easy, either. I bugged them for almost 2 years before they had a position opened, and that is not including the hundreds of other applications I did in the meantime). I admit that I got really really lucky, and would not be here if I wasn't already an internal candidate. I have been told that I should leave this job now anyway because it pays so low compared to other jr dev positions. I took the low pay because it is my very first jr dev job and I did not have much room to sell myself and didn't want to lose the opportunity because I got greedy with money.\n\nI want to take a break, but I keep reading it is an absolutely terrible idea to take a break and that companies look down on that and that it will make it much more harder to go back to school. When I started my associates degree, I was 25 so I was already out of high school for a good 7 or 8 years. I feel like I could do a year break and get back into it. But I also worry that schools won't look at me highly if I take a year break.\n\nI am hoping that if I do take a break, the fact that I had a 4.0 gpa and was in the honor society would make me still be someone they accept and possibly allow scholarships. I am afraid of taking on more student loans.",
