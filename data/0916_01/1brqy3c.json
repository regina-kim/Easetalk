Remember, it's okay to take small steps and adjust as you go. Your willingness to explore these changes is wonderful, and it shows your dedication to making things better for yourself. How about starting with planning one small activity each day that brings you joy or fulfillment? It could serve as a good anchor for your routine.

While you're doing finals home and relaxing is just constantly in the back of your mind. \"OK finish this final and I can pack up and go home\"\n\nYou arrive home, you see your pets and family and start falling back into your old habits after the first week or so.\n\nThen you realize most of your friends don't live in the same town anymore, and you find yourself just doom scrolling and struggling to find time to kill.\n\nThe rest is much needed but then you have to deal with parents  intrusion of your personal life, and ofc the house rules.\n\nAnd then the next semester starts and the cycle starts all over again.",
