I think I'm ready to do it, but I feel so behind and weird about starting as an older student (22F). It's weird for me to start when most people are finishing up. I'm already accepted at my local community college and can enroll anytime, but I'm really anxious about it. How common is it for students to start later in life? Thanks!!",
