I don't really fit in with the rest of my major, especially not my year, so that didn't work out all that well last semester. I was told by an upper classman in a different major who is very outgoing and goes out all of the time that I have to make friends now bc if I don't put myself out there everyone will gather into groups and be less willing to let you in. Is that really true? I'm not even shy, I jsut don't really work like that, but now I'm really worried I'm going to spend college alone",
