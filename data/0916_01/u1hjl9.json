This is the second time I almost reached a B, only to get dropped back down to a 62%. \n\nI can not just drop out for so many reasons. I was just wondering if it is normal to feel like this ?\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with taking classes online vs in person? I just... I can't focus on my professor, he is so boring. Ugh...",
