  "concern": "title: Master's Program Decision Advice Needed\nI'm a prospective master's student that applied to higher education programs. I got into both my top schools and my safety school (yay!!), but the top schools didn't offer me much in terms of scholarships. I just got an assistantship for my safety school that would cover pretty much everything, along with a stipend for living expenses. The issue is that the safety school isn't as good of a fit as the other schools in terms of my academic interests and career goals. I also don't have any loans from undergraduate, so I am okay with taking out loans for graduate school. Another factor is the safety school is my current undergraduate institution, so I wouldn't have to move unless I wanted to be closer to the school, whereas the other schools are either across the state or out of state. \n\nShould I take the full ride even though I'm not totally in love with the program? Or should I take out loans to go to a program that perfectly aligns with my goals? What helped you pick a program?",
