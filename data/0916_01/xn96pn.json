  "concern": "title: Group projects are so frustating\nCurrently I am taking a 4 credit upper level computer science course where every homework is a group project. I am frustrated on how things have been going in that class. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1st homework: Joined a group of 2 who were friends with each other. The homework was made up of two parts. Making the program and playing with it. They told me that they were done with parts of the homework. They weren't done. I did the whole programming part by myself because one of them didn't know how to code and the other member insisted that they use my code. (I find this fishy as when I was 70% done with the code, the other member basically had a running program. His program was failing autograder. When I offered help debugging, he insisted that he help me with my program) \n\nRegarding the other \"playing with the program\" part, The two other member discussed the problem mostly by themselves. I added some suggestions but they went on their own. Long story short, I probably would have saved more time and gotten a higher grade doing homework alone. I was frustrated on the group dynamic of two friends deciding what I should do. I found myself working on approach that I did not agree with and spent too much time fixing errors for their convoluted approach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2nd homework: Currently working with another classmate. the classmate hasn't done anything even though the homework is due in 2 days. (BTW homework for this class is 14 page behemoth). She says she had covid and have to catch up on classes. I tried to understand her situation. However, she hasn't even opened the shared document once. So frustrated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do you deal with this situation?",
