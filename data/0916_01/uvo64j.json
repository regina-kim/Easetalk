As you move forward, remember to be kind to yourself and take things one step at a time. Each small action you take is a step toward building the future you want. \n\nLet's set a next step where you can reach out to an advisor by the end of this week to have your initial discussion. And maybe look into a coding workshop that fits your schedule. Keep in mind that you have support, and you're not alone on this journey.
