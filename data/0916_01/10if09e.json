To be brief, I didn't really make new friends in my first two semesters of college (in-person) nor in my third semester (all online). I'm finally going back after a semester of taking classes at home, but only once a week for lab. I don't have time to join a club or go to school events, so that's not an option for making new friends. I don't plan on joining a fraternity nor do I intend on going to parties. I live somewhat far from campus, the city is big, and I don't drive nor do I want to spend money on Uber rides, so making plans (if I actually make new friends) would be hard. Basically, I want to see if I can make new friends in my lab class or whenever I get lunch, but I'm just socially awkward. It's not the same as making friends in K-12.",
