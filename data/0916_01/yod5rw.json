  "concern": "title: Should I major in Philosophy, sociology, or anthropology? will either three be a good career major?\nTL;DR: I absolutely enjoy commentary and video analysis essyas that delve into the behavior of people, what they've done, and why it happened/the concerns of it. Not in a psychology way however. I'm unsure what degree best fits my desires in discussing these topics and interacting with others. However, the catch is that I also like discussions and analysis in things that aren't related to collective people, but maybe something about dreams for instance, unless it still connects to people. \n\n\n\nI have quite some time to pick a major as I'm in 11th grade, however I believe I mad some changes in what I degree I wanted to pursue. I originally wanted to major in communications and minor in journalism, but I noticed how I have a keen taste for commentary and analysis essays in regards to concerning phenomenons that take place omg societies. For example, I watched a video on collective trauma as a generation and how that plays out, and how the video mentioned the \"spectacle\" in which people are more focused on what could conform to it (such as wanting representation in the media more than being focused on what could help with agriculture in the world). The person in the video said this, but I started to realize how often this takes place now. (I'll love to go into more detail, but I get carried away with writing lol) Anyways, it made me begin to rethink what I want to pursue as a degree, and what could compliment me the most. I enjoy asking questions and socializing, however I love analysis and understanding topics in regards to how people function based on what the topic is. Carl Jung deeply interested me because of my favorite boy band implementing ideologies into their music. Which led to me question if his takes are sociology, or philosophy. I want to intergrate either one with communications, as I aspire to be a journalist; or something similar to one. I know what I'm seeking out in a degree, but not sure what degree has what I'm looking for in the future. I'm intrigued by Carl Jung's theories on dreams as well, but not sure if that's sociology or philosophy either. I like watching those videos, or see something online that could seek to be controversial or a touchy opinion, and begin to ask peers, family, or others online what their stance is on it and why. Why do people have the tendency to gravitate to someone harmful for them? Why is it hard to understand how dreams work? The relations in the subconscious and unconscious? How does this affect the functionality of people? Etc. I want to turn it into a career path, something to pursue. But I don't know what name to put to it. I mad an essay on why is it hard to be ethical online too. I can't just simply tell if sociology or philosophy is the name, or if they go hand in hand. Heck, if I can do both in college whole still minoring in communications. I'm unsure if either will be able to help me have a stable career future as well.\n\n[What best explains the type of videos I watch](https://youtu.be/jlIBGl5-j_4)",
