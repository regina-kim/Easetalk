I really enjoy art/music and I could go to community college for that, although I really feel like university seems much more fun and I would feel more fulfilled. I also love learning about everything but I don’t want to end have a conventional job, because I’m a much more creative person.\n\nI’m a little introverted meaning I don’t seek relationships but I love going out and having fun. I want to go to university because it pools a bunch of people my age together and I will obviously make friends and make great memories. It seems like just working and not attending any school would make me feel like I’m missing a chapter in my life.\n\nHas anyone else ever felt this way? I just feel really lost and lonely",
