  "concern": "title: I've been stuck on where to go to college for months.\nI'm an incoming college freshman planning on studying biochemistry for undergrad and wanting to go the pre-med track. \n\nI committed to Texas A&amp;M a couple of months ago, but my dad wants me to go to UTD because he believes it's better financially. My tuition for both schools are covered completely by financial aid that I don't have to pay back, so my only financial issue is cost of living. Since I've committed to TAMU, I've already found an apartment, done all the pre-NSC requirements, and have my NSC in a couple of days. However, some events came up where I am now unsure as to whether I can even make it at TAMU without constantly being stressed about finances. I honestly don't care at this point about which school I attend, but my only issue with UTD is that I would be living at home and commuting there which is roughly 45 minutes to an hour. If I have a morning class this would be a bit of a problem. Even though this issue isn't really that big of a deal, I would really like any advice about how to navigate this.",
