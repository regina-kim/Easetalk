I was/am so excited to be moving forward with my life and have this chance to study what I love.\n\nI’ve been here a month but school just started this week.\n\nToday it just hit me how alone I am. I know no one in this state. My roommates are cool but they are religious and I don’t think they approve of my life style. I am openly bisexual.\n\nMy department is so small and everyone know each other already. They are all friendly but I feel like an outsider.\n\nI am all alone and have no one to talk to or to spend time with. My family is 100s of miles away.\n\nDid anyone else feel like this when they first started grad school? How did you meet people? Will it get better once classes start to pick up?",
