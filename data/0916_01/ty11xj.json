I'm new to this app so sorry for any mistakes!\n\nI have recently started my second year of college and I'm feeling very anxious atm. \n\nI'm a full time student and I also work and try to exercise at least a couple of times a week but i just feel like there isn't enough hours in a day.\n\nI feel like I'm already behind on all my assignments and that makes me very stressed and anxious.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips? whether they are for anxiety/stress management or simply how to organize myself better.\n\nThanks!",
