  "concern": "title: Any Red Flags I Missed?\nHi all, \n\nI'm in a thesis STEM MS where the professors/PIs largely choose students instead of having students rotate in labs or reach out to potential PIs. I was brought in to work on a few collaborative projects where the PIs and my advisor are not the same people. This was never mentioned to me, and I happened to find out when an undergrad and I were talking. For various reasons, any and all projects I was supposed to use for my thesis are either disjointed, have been delayed, or will no longer happen (it's been an entire semester and I've done no work on anything). Turns out my advisor merely \"consults\" on 1 of them and failed to mention she is not a PI on any project right now, is powerless to move them along, and seems to care a little less every day. This is slowly becoming more of an issue that could possibly keep me from graduating on time. \n\nIs any of this unusual, or is it just how it goes in academia sometimes? Is having an advisor who is not my PI problematic?",
