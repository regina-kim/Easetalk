As you practice sticking to this boundary, you might find more room for energy and enjoyment in other areas of your life too.\n\nYou’re doing a great job recognizing what you need. Keep in mind, it's okay if it takes a little time to get used to this change. Celebrate the small victories along the way, like successfully stopping at 8 PM a couple of times a week initially, and gradually building from there.\n\nFor your next steps, perhaps try setting a gentle reminder for yourself about your study end time or plan a relaxing activity for after. If you ever need additional support or just want to talk about how things are going, feel free to reach out. You're not alone in this, and you're taking positive steps toward feeling more balanced. Keep up the good work; you’ve got this!",
