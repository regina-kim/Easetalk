It’s inspiring to see your commitment to making this experience different and more positive for yourself.\n\nLet's plan for your next steps: maybe start by outlining a few small, achievable goals you’re comfortable with and consider how often you’d like those check-ins to be. Remember, reaching out for support, whether it’s through tutoring or talking to someone, is always a strength. Your journey back to college is unique to you, and each step you take is a move towards your goal. I'm here to support you as you start implementing these plans.

  "concern": "title: Tips for potentially going back to college?\nI dropped out in my second year of psychology coz it was quite hard. Looking back I think while yes it was hard I definitely didn’t put in as much effort as I could have. Oops. I’m wanting to potentially go back and try again but I’m worried it will in fact be too hard even if I try really hard this time. I don’t think I could deal with everyone’s disappointment in me for a second time. Should I reapply for next year? Or does anyone have any degree suggestions similar to psych that may not be “as intense”? \nCheers!",
