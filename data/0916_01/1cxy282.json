I admire your willingness to try something new—it's a strong step towards managing stress. As you begin using the planner, you might also notice patterns or areas you want to adjust further, which is all part of the process.\n\nFor now, focus on getting comfortable with your planner over the next week. Feel free to jot down any observations or challenges you come across. We can discuss these in our next session to tweak and reinforce your strategy. You're making great progress by taking these steps, and I’m here to support you as you explore these new skills. Keep up the good work!",
