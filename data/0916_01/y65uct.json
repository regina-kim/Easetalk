Let's summarize your next steps: you'll start exploring internships that align with your interests and look into joining clubs that focus on real-world projects. Another key strategy might be to break these goals into smaller tasks, like researching potential companies or clubs and reaching out for more information.\n\nIt's commendable that you're taking proactive steps toward your future—this shows a lot of determination. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. If you ever feel overwhelmed, revisiting your priorities can be helpful.\n\nGoing forward, perhaps setting a goal to apply to a certain number of internships or attend a few club meetings each week could keep you on track. I'm here to support you, and we can review your progress together. How does that sound as a plan to move forward?",

  "concern": "title: Feel like my college is useless\nI’ve been getting As and A+s since college started, and I’m almost never getting challenged. This isn’t to brag, I’m not that smart, but I am diligent. It’s more like most of my classes are online and most of those are evaluated based on coursework and final “reports” rather than exams, which makes it very easy to get very good grades for me, since I don’t actually have to study at all, except for the week I’m writing the report.\n\nI have literally not had a single in person exam since I got into uni, and even courses where I barely understand anything I get an A or A+ on. I’m in CS, and I was expecting to learn some actually useful skills. Now I’m in 3rd year, supposed to be looking for jobs and internships, but feel woefully unprepared for anything. Literally feels like I haven’t learned a single useful thing since high school. We did have some programming courses, but the most complex thing they had us build is an angry birds clone in Java. \n\nI’ve started to learn HTML/CSS on my own time just so I can have SOME form of marketable skill, but I’m always worrying about my future. Idk if I’ll find a job at this rate. This is supposed to be a top 10 school in Japan too….",
