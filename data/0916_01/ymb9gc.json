I'm finally at the point where I can get my masters from it, but my will to live is basically gone. It's not the work I came to grad school to do, it doesn't get at any of the things I wanted to study in grad school, and it's taken 70% of my grad school career that I can't get back, and I don't even make enough money to buy something that can distract me from how miserable I am. I have 1 month to get the thesis finished, and every time I open it I just start crying. I'm not even sure it's worth it anymore and I don't know what to do. I want something to show for my time in grad school but I just hate this work so much. I don't want to interpret the stats, I don't care about the results, just hearing the project topic makes me want to take my laptop and smash it into little tiny pieces.",
