  "concern": "title: Asking for perspective (BS with concentration vs just BS General, then go for masters)\nHey guys. I don't post on anything, but I kinda wanted to ask a large amount of people something so that I could get insight. \n\nFirst, to explain my situation.  I did not take schooling seriously at first, just sorta wasted time at the library since no one would question what I did there (eat junk food and binge youtube haha). But now I've shaped up, and found something I'm really interested in and passionate about, Geology. My favorite focus is water.\n\nAt my school, they offer a General Geology Degree that requires a minor(I've been going for a Creative Writing Minor and that's going perfectly). They also offer a Professional Geology Degree that can focus on Geology or Hydrogeology(what I like).\n\nMy main question is, is it worth it to pay more and spend more time in undergrad to get a BS with a concentration or just getting the BS without the concentration, and go for grad school?\n\nI just started taking my schooling seriously and will have a sit down with a Geology advisor (since I haven't really used these services since I was dumb af) later, but wanted to get random strangers opinions just in case someone brings up something I didn't know.\n\nAdditionally, how will it look when I'm looking for a job? In Geology, most jobs require a masters, so getting a BS with concentration doesn't seem with it, and I should just go to grad school and pursue a masters in something like that(Hydrogeology, Hydraulic Engineering, etc. I like water a lot haha)",
