If you ever find it difficult to stick to the plan, know that it's perfectly okay to adjust it as needed. \n\nIt’s encouraging to see you taking these steps towards your goal.

  "concern": "title: Students of reddit, any advice on how to keep at the studies?\nHi everyone!\n\nI'm in my third year of a five year computer science program in university. I had a real easy time with my studies in gymnasium, not only that I understood things easily but I also studied really hard. Now that I'm university I've noticed that my ability to study has significantly decreased.\n\nIt even started in my first year as I started failing classes, now I've fought real hard and made good progress and as such I'm basically where I should be in terms of my studies but I am still not happy with how much I study. Currently I might spend around 5 hours a day studying...\n\nI'm looking for advice on how to turn this around, how do ya'll do it? What makes you wake up and spend 8 solid hours on your studies five times a week?",
