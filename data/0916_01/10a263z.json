California is extremely expensive and i would have to find a way to move my lizard and snake across the country from where I live in Connecticut. They also said i probably would get homesick and miss them. they said if i dont think i will that will change once i actually leave.\n\nthe problem is i really really miss california, i miss my best friend a lot. i'm just worried about the potential consequences of moving so far",
