  "concern": "title: I've changed my degree twice now and have no idea if I should keep my current one!! Any advice is helpful üò≠\nI'm in my last semester of my Associates. I was a Music major which I quickly realized was a mistake I don't really like the formality and composition and you don't really need a degree to play stuff you enjoy. I decided Education would be good I've always loved Mathematics, but as I started to do it I realized I like playing with the formulas and solving the problems more than teaching the concepts to people, so I changed to just Mathematics. Now as I'm looking at possible careers when I (eventually) get my Master's , they just don't really interest me, they seem to deal with more financial things that primarily benefit the private company rather than people. I really want to be able to continuously work on stuff that helps people, I don't want my name on it or anything like that, but I just want to know what I'm doing is benefitting people. So I thought maybe an engineering degree, even software engineering, though I have no knowledge of how that works. Basically, should I stick with what I'm doing? Maybe minor in computer science to give myself an advantage trying to get into a software engineering program? What are my options? If anyone has any info anything is appreciated üôè",
