The problem is that his lectures are kind of confusing, and when the class finishes, I feel like it doesn’t help me to better understand the material. I’ve also heard his exams can be tricky. I’m scared that I’ll fail this class, I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I failed. How have you dealt with failing a class?",
