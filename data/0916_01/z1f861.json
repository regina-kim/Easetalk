I graduate in just a few weeks, but I have had such a blast this semester and made so many friends whom I feel actually care about me. I have depression but this is the happiest I’ve ever been. It may be silly and stupid to want to stay another semester to be with my friends, but I’m really afraid of growing apart from them especially since I live multiple states away from everyone. I’ve been wondering if I should take a minor in Graphic Design (Which is something I’ve been interested in for a while now) but I just don’t know if in the long run it would be worth it. Has anyone else been in this situation before and has some advice?",
