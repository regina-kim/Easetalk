You’ll be setting a consistent study schedule, exploring tutor options, and possibly joining a study group. These are clear and actionable steps toward mastering those math concepts.\n\nBeing proactive in seeking support is a great strategy. Remember, you're building not just math skills, but also resilience and adaptability which will serve you well in your grad program and beyond. \n\nAs you move forward, feel free to reach out for more support or adjustments to your plan. You're not alone in this, and you’re already making strides toward overcoming that wall. Keep up the great effort!",

  "concern": "title: How do I get through grad school?\nPretty sure there are several posts similar to mine, but I don't know who to ask for advice. I naively joined a master's program in computer science this September, simply because I felt like my undergraduate degree taught me nothing and i want to learn the concepts in a better institution. One month in and I am barely holding back my tears. I know it wasn't going to be easy but I took a subject called mathematical foundations, and I am absolutely unable to comprehend it. The other 2 subjects i took are definitely hard but i feel like with an extreme amount of effort, i can do my best and learn well. But with math foundations, i don't know what to do. I don't know how the rest of my classmates feel about the subject, but i do know that one friend is finding it quite easy. I have spent several hours going through the basics of linear algebra and it still doesn't change the fact that i am not able to comprehend the subject. I'm not saying I've given up, but i want to ask if this is a natural feeling that some of you all may have felt for some subjects. How did you get through this, and 4 semesters of this? Can you provide some tips on how to manage the semester, especially if you've considered yourself an average/below average student?",
