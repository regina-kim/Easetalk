  "concern": "title: Take an extra semester/year and study computer science, or finish faster and study communications, or black studies + gender/sexualities studies\nHi! I am currently in cc and I will be getting my associates in communications this spring. Should I continue in cc for an extra semester and take some computer science prereqs (specifically for CSUMB or CSUDH), or should I just stick with my communications degree and go somewhere like csulb for communications? I also applied to csueb for black studies (online) and would double concentrate with gender + sexuality studies if I choose to go there. An online degree would be preferable to me since I work full time and don’t drive yet. I think the csulb communications program can be completed online (it says “approved for distance education” so idk what that means). I’d love to finish my degree as soon as possible. I just don’t know what I would do with one of these liberal arts degrees. CS would guarantee me a job. I’m interested in it enough to where I think I can handle the degree, but I don’t know anything more that html and css, so I have no idea how I feel about the more intense stuff. Does anyone have some uplifting success stories for a liberal arts major? Or should I just double down on CS? Literally the only thing I’m worried about with a liberal arts degree is job opportunities. Idk what I can even do with a communications degree!!!!\n\nPlease help I’m so stuck and have had a lot of doubt in my current major career wise. I just want some info or reassurance on getting a liberal arts degree, or even reasons I should take more time in school for CS.\n\nTLDR: can either take an extra semester to a year to study comp sci, or finish faster for a liberal arts degree (comm or “identity” studies). What should I choose? Interested enough in both routes. just feeling stuck. Career options?",
