  "concern": "title: Is anyone else struggling with feeling aimless during summer?\nHi there, 20F here\nJust wondering how you all fare during the summer. My last final was three weeks ago, and I just finished junior year. I work very hard and do well in school, but once it ends and I go from a rigid structure to nothing I feel disoriented and directionless.\n\nPart of it is that I feel the need to be constantly making progress. Another part is that I am pressuring myself to be figuring out my career path, because I hate not knowing exactly what I want to do. I'm good at school, but I'm also afraid that I won't be good at working and applying my skills to practical situations.\n\nSome of these fears are irrational--I've worked before, I've done great and I've discovered some aspects of my career that I like and dislike. I want to explore the medical field but I'm not sure if I could be hired for only 3-4 months as an entry level worker and then leave to go back to school.\n\nBasically summer gives me lots of generalized anxiety about my life and future that I don't have time to stew on during the school year. I know the obvious solution is to make arrangements for summer plans ahead of time so I don't run into this, but I had a short term change in my living situation and so I'm in a new place away from my university and feeling like everything is unfamiliar.\n\nSo much empty time and I'm not sure what to do with it.",
