  "concern": "title: Burnout making me flop this Semester\nI’ve lost a lot of motivation towards my studies and career, dealing with anxiety and depression and my grades are about to take the ultimate plunge as a result. I only took 4 classes this summer to minimize the work load, but I don’t even think I’m gonna pass a single class. I want to take time off to rediscover my passion that I had in the first place and find myself (I know that sounds corny, I just think I’ve been in autopilot productive mode &amp; haven’t really tapped into my mental health needs in a long time (graduated hs at 16, started college at 17. Now in my final semester of sophomore year at 19). I really want to go to grad school to become a school counselor/psychologist. I have a 3.2 gpa, am I doomed?",
