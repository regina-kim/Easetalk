  "concern": "title: Repercussions to quitting internship early\nI’m currently doing a remote international internship with a startup company (i’m a rising junior). My contract technically states I end on September 30th as I entered it in April, BUT my boss had made it clear she wanted me to work for 6 months via email (so around end of November as I actually started doing work in May).\n\nI feel like I’m in way over my head and that I won’t have time to do an internship alongside my studies once college starts. I want to quit by September 30th but am scared as to what she would say/what would happen if I don’t stick it out for 6 months (I’ve been working for ~2 months now and quitting in September would make it a total of 4 months).\n\nI’m debating talking to her about it but don’t know what to say. Will there be any repercussions if I end this internship on a bad note? Any tips or advice would be much appreciated!",
