What career path can I choose if I live both English ( analyzing, creativity, dealing with people and humanities) and mathematics (logic, deduction , problem solving)? I want a job that requires a multitude of skills, is tangent with the world ( meaning nothing like a teaching job that deals with repetitive material only). \n\nThank you for any response in advance!!",
