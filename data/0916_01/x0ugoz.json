There are two programs that are very appealing to me and would both be beneficial in my future career. I favor one slightly more than the other, but I can get the one I favor less for 50% of the cost because of the internship I am currently in.\n\nWould it make sense to complete the discounted one, and get the other afterwards if I still thought it would be beneficial? Each program is an online intensive that takes between a year and a year and a half to complete, so theoretically I could have a Bachelor's and two Master's by the time I'm 25, which sounds worth it to me. I'm a first-gen college student and the only person I know from my family who has pursued a graduate degree, so I really don't know what is standard. Any advice?",
