  "concern": "title: Overwhelmed\nI (19TM) am currently in my sophomore year of college. I just started the fall semester and I'm drowning.\n\nLast year I had a decent amount of homework but I never had trouble getting it turned in on time. And I had plenty of time to see my friends, relax, eat, and work on personal projects that interest me. This semester has been different. I have 3+ assignments due every single day, I'm in two art studios that are only worth three credits each, but you have to be in for six hours every week. I've had assignments I had to turn in incomplete because I ran out of time. And it's not for lack of trying, I'm doing homework literally every free second I get between class, meals, and sleep. I don't get enough sleep, I don't eat enough, and I have exactly zero time for personal creative endeavors.\n\nI'm exhausted all the time, I have days where my anxiety gets so bad I burst into tears just from stress, and yet I haven't been able to slow down even a bit. It's this, or drop out. The only way out is through.\n\nI'm writing this post as I wait for my computer to update so that I can finish a writing assignment and a quiz that are both due tonight, and I have some art project stuff that's due in class tomorrow, which means it needs to get done tonight. I'll probably be up late trying to finish it which means I won't get enough sleep again. Tomorrow evening I need to start working on an essay that's due Friday (it's currently Wednesday), and I also have a workbook page due that day. And it doesn't get any better after that. Every class has loaded me down with more assignments than is even remotely reasonable, and I'm only taking four classes because I had to drop one. I was originally taking five, but it quickly became apparent it literally was not going to be possible to complete all five of them and balance all the work. But I'm starting to get worried even four is going to be too much with the ungodly amount of work these professors assign. My dishes have piled high, my laundry has been sitting in my corner unfolded for days, I desperately need a shower, and I have online job training I need to complete at some point. I haven't had even a second to spare for any of it because every second has been dedicated to homework. If I do get a second to breath, I'm so desperate to finally relax and get even a moment to not be working that I cannot summon the will to do chores.\n\nI know that the way I'm living right now is not healthy, but what's the alternative? Stop turning in assignments and fail my classes? Drop out of school? Neither of those are possible for me. As stressful as it is, I love school and one hard semester would never be enough to make me accept failure.\n\nYou might suggest I drop another class, but that's not an option either. If I go down to three classes I'll become a part-time student which means I would lose my scholarship. And I can't afford college without it.\n\nThere's really not much I can do other than tough it out, I just desperately needed to complain about my situation somewhere. It's been weighing on me for awhile. I would go to therapy, but I don't have time. I've had to postpone doctor's appointments of all kinds, I haven't been able to hangout with friends unless it's study session, and I haven't been able to work on my book that I'm writing or make any new art without sacrificing homework time that invariably ends up hitting my grade in that class. It's currently week 6 of 16 at my university, plus finals week. So I'm not even halfway done and I'm already crippled by how much work I have, and it's not going to slow down anytime soon.\n\nThis just really, truly sucks.",
