I initially had 18 units, but I dropped one class because I felt it was too much; however, I kind of have to cram some classes in so I was wondering--is 18 units doable or worth it? will it be too stressful, or does it depend on individual experience based on class difficulty, the professor, etc? if anyone here has taken 18 units in one semester, what was it like for you?\n\nalso I am trying to transfer from a community college to a university, so I still have some required classes to complete that's why",
