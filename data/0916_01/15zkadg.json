You've shown a lot of insight into what might work best for you.\n\nThis week, your focus could be on contacting a couple of classmates to form that study group and planning your tasks in smaller steps. Remember to be kind to yourself as you navigate these changes. Each small step is progress, and I believe in your ability to handle this transition.\n\nShould you feel overwhelmed, coming back to your support system—whether it's peers, a buddy, or using reminders—can help you stay grounded. You're already taking important strides toward creating a balanced college experience. Keep leaning into your strengths, and know that support is always here for you as you continue on this journey.",

  "concern": "title: Does anyone else feel overwhelmed with college?\nIt’s my 2nd day being a Freshman on campus just moving in and honestly I feel so overwhelmed. I’m overwhelmed with worrying about my classes and being in a new environment and missing my parents :( I got placed in both Bio and Chem and I’m scared it will be too much and I’m going to fail. I keep hearing all these stories of people barely keeping up and having to study late into the night. Also how my professors say for every hour of class, study for 2 outside of class, that will lead me to have to study for around 17 hours cause my labs are quite long (not even counting my 2 other classes). I’m worried I won’t have any free time or life outside of college to pursue my hobbies or just have a life in general. Does anyone have any words of advice of words of comfort, im straight up not having a good time right now :(\n\nThank you for reading this",
