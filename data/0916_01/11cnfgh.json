  "concern": "title: what can i do if high school severely under-prepared me for college?\nto summarize, my HS was a (very brand new) trade school that had a lot of issues with classes and credits when i was enrolled there. i graduated with pretty good grades and got into a college i wanted, but upon trying to register for classes, i realized i hadn’t even met the requirements to take prerequisite courses of stuff like english and math. let alone the complete lack of any extracurriculars, since they weren’t offered in HS. i got enrolled in some of the most base level courses in college and it really demotivated me and made me feel like i wasn’t getting anywhere. that plus mental health and a few other factors made me drop out half a semester into my first year. \n\nit’s been a long while since then and i’m thinking about going back, but i still only have what i had from HS and that’s it, not even personal portfolios or anything else. is there anything i should do before i try to reenroll? or is there any strategies i could try to do what i need while also not falling behind? thank you :)",
