  "concern": "title: No Clue What to Do About Nightmare Roommate\nI live in a triple, and my one roommate, we’ll call them A, is a nightmare. My other roommate, we’ll call them B, is very nice and accommodating, and I feel like she doesn’t want to do anything about A because of how accommodating she is.\n\nFirst of all, I’ve only physically seen A shower twice since we got here a month ago, and she smells very bad. Any space in the room she walks in will stink. And I mean STINK. It’s awful to not be able to come back to my dorm after a long day of classes and relax because of her smell. It’s only been a month, so I don’t know how long I can keep this up for because I’m already tired of it. She also never does her laundry, as in I have not seen her do laundry the entire time we’ve been here. \n\nSecond, she won’t let me or B touch the AC. If I manage to change it to a more comfortable temperature, she will change it back twenty minutes later as if I won’t notice. We don’t pay extra for AC so I don’t see why she’s so adamant on not using it, even on 80 degree days. I wake up drenched in sweat. \n\nThird, she hits snooze on her alarm clock AT LEAST 5 times before she wakes up. Today was 7. Not exaggerating. 7. It’s so annoying when I get woken up every 10 minutes for two hours straight. \n\nThe alarm clock thing I feel I can just address with her face to face because she’s not a mean person necessarily, and I’m not asking much. \n\nHowever, I don’t know if I can look at someone in the eye and tell them they smell. Maybe I can ask B if she has noticed it, too, and we can talk to her together, but I really don’t want to create animosity in the room. \n\nI fear if I tell the RA, it will humiliate A and thus create animosity in the room. \n\nI really like my dorm and B, so I would rather not move out, but I can’t live like this with A anymore. What do I do?",
