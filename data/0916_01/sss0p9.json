  "concern": "title: Professor's instructions often unclear? What's the deal?\nI keep running into this issue where instructors will often give vague instructions on assignments and I'm not sure what to do about it. Do I just need to get better at navigating vague teachers? Or is this not supposed to be happening?\n\n___\n\n**Exhibit A:**\n\nFor example, I just got my grade back for a programming project in which I was apparently not allowed to edit certain parts of the code that was provided. I got docked quite a few points for this mistake so I double checked the grading rubric and there is no mention of any restrictions on editing the prewritten code. I scroll down to the very bottom and of course, hidden in the middle of an FAQ section, is the warning to not edit prewritten code. Yes, I should probably be reading every single word of every piece of instruction just in case, but isn't the FAQ generally optional reading? Why is there crucial grading criteria in an FAQ section and but nowhere to be found in the actual \"Grading Criteria\" section?\n\n___\n\n**Exhibit B:**\n\nAnother professor, this same quarter, docked me for not formatting the output of a program in exactly the right way. The rubric does mention that \"the output must be in the required format\" but it didn't specify what the format is. While I was working on this assignment, I read through the whole rubric a couple of times and couldn't find any other mention of a \"required format\". When I turned it in, I added a note on canvas that basically read: \"I wasn't sure what you meant by required format. Please let me know if there are any issues. I can send you the source code if you need to look at it for grading purposes\".\n\nShe graded the assignment with a very dismissive response saying simply \"Numerical output was not in the required format\". I had to ask her again about this \"required format\" and she  responds with \"There was a sample line of code provided in the PDF file\". I look back at the instruction PDF and there is an example piece of code much later in the assignment that states \"you ***may*** use fprintf() to output a ***desired*** format\" but the wording does not suggest in any way that this ***is*** the ***required*** format above. The wording makes it seem like a completely unrelated suggestion or helpful tip rather than a strict requirement, especially since it appears many paragraphs after any mention of a ***required*** format.\n\n___\n\nAm I losing it? If this is happening in multiple classes in the same quarter then it must be me right? But I feel like there are *definitely* some huge communication issues going on. I'm not really sure what to think. Hopefully this post doesn't come off too ranty. I'm just not sure what to do. Why does this keep happening? Is interpreting vague instruction just a skill I need to develop? Or should I be talking to my teachers about this?",
