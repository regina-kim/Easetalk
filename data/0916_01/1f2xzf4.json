I applied to so many teaching positions but none led to anything. Except for one professor that hired me but because her class got low enrollment it was downgraded to a grader position so I don’t get the tuition waiver. I’ve applied to a few scholarships but decisions won’t come until later in the semester. I’m not sure if I should just continue with the semester hoping for things to get better. Going to class everyday feels like a chore. I feel like an imposter and wonder if I should be here. I’m considering taking a semester off but I was advised to just take the entire year off due to the nature of my program. I’m so happy to see all my friends and thinking I probably won’t be with them for the year hurts me. I’ve been applying to jobs as plan b but even that hasn’t bored any fruits. I’m so scared yall. Just needed to rant ",
