Have you had a chance to explore any of the related fields in biology that you're interested in?\nclient: I've looked into a few biology majors online, but I haven't delved deeply into them yet. This exploration is highlighting my uncertainty about whether to stick with psychology or switch paths.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're facing a difficult decision, and it's completely understandable to feel uncertain at this point. Making a decision about your academic path can have a significant impact on your future, so it's important to take the time to explore your options and gather as much information as possible. Have you considered reaching out to academic advisors or professors in both psychology and biology to gain more insight into the fields and potential career paths?\nclient: I haven't reached out to academic advisors or professors yet, but it's something I've been considering as I weigh my options. I'm still trying to figure out if sticking with psychology or exploring biology more aligns with my passions.\ntherapist: It's good to hear that you're keeping an open mind and considering different perspectives as you make this important decision. Gathering more information and speaking with advisors or professors can provide valuable insights and help you gain a clearer understanding of what each field entails. Remember that it's okay to take your time and make a well-informed decision. Is there anything specific about psychology or biology that you find particularly interesting or engaging?\nclient: In psychology, I'm drawn to exploring human behavior and emotions, which feels personally relevant to my daily life. For biology, the idea of studying ecosystems and life processes intrigues me as it might open up new career avenues I'm still evaluating.\ntherapist: It seems like you find value in both psychology and biology, with psychology appealing to your interest in understanding human behavior and emotions, while biology captures your fascination with ecosystems and life processes. It might be helpful to further explore the potential career paths in each field and see which aligns better with your long-term goals. Have you considered any specific careers within psychology or biology that you might find fulfilling?\nclient: I've considered careers like counseling in psychology due to my interest in human behavior, and environmental science in biology because of its focus on ecosystems. I'm still evaluating which path aligns more with my overall passions and goals.\ntherapist: It's great that you're thinking about specific careers like counseling and environmental science. This can help you gain a clearer picture of what each field offers. To make a more informed decision, consider reaching out to professionals in these areas to learn about their experiences and day-to-day work. Additionally, think about your personal strengths and values to determine which path might be more fulfilling. Do you feel that your skills and interests are more suited to working with individuals in a counseling setting or addressing environmental issues on a broader scale?\nclient: I feel my skills in communication and empathy might suit working with individuals in a counseling setting, but my interests in environmental issues could make addressing broader ecological problems more fulfilling. I'm still weighing these options to see which better aligns with my long-term goals.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you're taking the time to weigh your options, considering both your skills and interests. Reflecting on your long-term goals and envisioning the impact you'd like to make can help guide your decision. While it's important to consider your skills in communication and empathy that could be beneficial in counseling, your passion for addressing environmental issues may also present an opportunity to make a meaningful difference in the world. Remember that you can always explore ways to incorporate your interests in human behavior and emotions into your work, even if you decide to focus on environmental science.\nclient: I appreciate the suggestion of blending my interests, but I'm still unsure if focusing on environmental science would fully utilize my empathy in helping people. Overall, I need to determine which path will best align with my skills and passions for making a difference.\ntherapist: Balancing your skills, passions, and desire to make a positive impact can indeed be challenging. One approach could be envisioning your future self in both careers and considering which one brings you the most satisfaction and fulfillment. Imagine yourself as a counselor, using your empathy to support individuals, and then picture yourself as an environmental scientist, working on projects that protect ecosystems and address global issues. Reflect on which scenario resonates more deeply with your aspirations and values.\nclient: I tried visualizing myself as a counselor, using my empathy to help people, and it felt rewarding, but picturing a role in environmental science also excited me by addressing larger issues. Ultimately, I'm still trying to decide which path will let me make the most meaningful impact with my skills.\ntherapist: It's clear that both paths have their merits and resonate with you in different ways. Perhaps you could explore interdisciplinary fields or dual degree programs that combine aspects of psychology and environmental science, allowing you to make a unique impact using your empathy and communication skills. This could be an opportunity to create a tailored career path that aligns with your passions and aspirations.\nclient: That sounds like a promising way to combine my interests. I'm still figuring out if an interdisciplinary path would best channel my empathy and skills into making a real difference.\ntherapist: It's great that you're open to exploring interdisciplinary options. To help clarify your decision, consider reaching out to professionals in both fields or seeking informational interviews with individuals in interdisciplinary roles. Hearing about their experiences and the impact they've made could provide valuable insights as you navigate your academic journey and tailor your path to align with your passions and skills.\nclient: That could be a helpful step to gain more clarity on how my skills might fit into different paths. I'm still weighing which direction would allow me to make the most meaningful impact overall.\ntherapist: While considering the potential impact of each path, it might be helpful to envision your future self in both scenarios. Imagine yourself as a counselor, using your empathy to support individuals in need, or as an environmental scientist, working towards solutions for pressing environmental issues. Reflect on which vision resonates more deeply with you and the legacy you wish to leave in the world.\nclient: I can see how envisioning those paths might help me clarify what's most fulfilling. It's making me reflect on whether my empathy would lead to a greater impact in direct human connections or broader scientific contributions.\ntherapist: It's great to hear that you're contemplating the impact of your empathy in both contexts. To further explore this, consider making a list of specific ways your empathy could contribute to each field. For instance, in counseling, it might help you build strong connections with clients, while in environmental science, it could enable you to foster understanding and collaboration among stakeholders. Comparing these lists may offer additional insights into where your empathy can make the most meaningful impact.\nclient: I'll consider making that list to compare how my empathy might play out in counseling versus environmental science. This could help me better gauge which path aligns more with my desire to create meaningful impact in the world.\ntherapist: As you create your list and weigh the potential impact of your empathy in each field, it might be helpful to also consider the personal fulfillment you'd experience in each role. Reflect on which path would provide you with the greatest sense of purpose and satisfaction, as this will be essential to your long-term happiness and success.\nclient: I'll definitely think about how personal fulfillment might differ between counseling and scientific fields, as that could clarify which path truly resonates with my empathy-driven goals. This reflection will help me weigh my options more effectively for the future.\ntherapist: To support your decision-making process, it might be helpful to visualize yourself in both roles. Imagine a typical day as a counselor and another as an environmental scientist. Envision the tasks, interactions, and environments associated with each profession. This exercise can provide a clearer picture of which path aligns better with your empathy and goals.\nclient: I'll try visualizing a day as a counselor to see how it feels compared to one in environmental science, focusing on how each might channel my empathy differently. This exercise should help clarify which path better aligns with my goal of making a meaningful impact.\ntherapist: As you visualize your role in each field, pay attention to the emotions and thoughts that arise. Notice if you feel more connected or excited about one profession over the other, as this can be a valuable indicator of which path aligns more closely with your empathy and aspirations.\nclient: I'll pay close attention to the emotions and thoughts that surface during my visualization, noting which profession sparks more excitement or connection. This insight will help me better align my choice with my empathy and desire for meaningful impact.\ntherapist: To further solidify your decision, consider creating a list that compares how your empathy might contribute to each field. This can help you visualize the potential impact you could make in each profession and provide a clearer understanding of which path aligns better with your goals.\n\n That's a great idea! I'll create a list outlining how my empathy can contribute to both psychology and biology. This will help me assess the potential impact I could make in each field and guide me toward the path that aligns best with my goals.\nclient: I'll definitely create that list to compare how my empathy could play out in psychology versus biology. This approach will help me gauge which path feels more right for channeling my desire to make a positive difference.","completed":false}

It's been tough to stay focused and make progress on what I need to do.\ntherapist: It sounds like youre feeling weighed down by your academic obligations. That can be really challenging. Can you tell me more about what specifically is contributing to your feelings of overwhelm?\nclient: I've been dealing with a lot of tight deadlines and upcoming exams, which makes it hard to prioritize my tasks. On top of that, I often find myself procrastinating or getting distracted instead of making progress.\ntherapist: It's clear that you're dealing with a lot right now. Juggling deadlines, exams, and staying focused can be really difficult. Have you tried any strategies to help manage your time or stay on track?\nclient: I've tried organizing my digital files and creating to-do lists to get myself motivated, but they haven't helped me stay focused as much as I'd hoped. It's still tough to break through the overwhelm and actually start on my assignments.\ntherapist: It seems like despite your efforts to organize and create to-do lists, you're still struggling with staying focused and overcoming procrastination. Have you considered seeking support from your school's academic counseling or peer tutoring services? They may be able to offer additional resources or strategies to help you manage your workload and develop effective study habits.\nclient: I've mostly relied on the therapists for support so far, but I haven't explored academic counseling or peer tutoring yet. The ongoing overwhelm from deadlines makes it challenging to seek out additional help, even though I know it could be beneficial.\ntherapist: It's understandable that seeking additional help might feel like an added burden right now. However, it's important to remember that these resources are designed to support students in situations like yours. It might be worth considering reaching out to your school's counseling services to explore what options are available, as they could provide valuable guidance and tools to manage your academic responsibilities more effectively.\nclient: I appreciate the suggestion, but the idea of adding more steps right now feels overwhelming on top of my deadlines. I'll try to muster the energy to look into those services soon, as I know it could help me get back on track.\ntherapist: It's great that you're open to exploring those options when you feel able to. Remember, taking small steps is okay, and it's important to be gentle with yourself during challenging times. Is there anything specific you think might help you feel more prepared to seek additional support?\nclient: I think having a simple checklist of steps to follow could make seeking support feel less daunting. Maybe starting with just one small action, like emailing a counselor, would help me build momentum without adding too much pressure.\ntherapist: That's a great idea! Breaking down the process into manageable steps can make it easier to take action. Why don't you start by drafting a brief email to a counselor, expressing your concerns and requesting information about available support services? This small step could set the ball rolling and help alleviate some of the pressure you're feeling.\nclient: I like the idea of drafting a short email as a first step, since it feels more approachable than bigger actions right now. I'll try to do that soon to ease into seeking more support without overwhelming myself further.\ntherapist: Great! To make it even more manageable, would you prefer setting a specific time for drafting the email, like this evening after dinner, or connecting it to a daily habit, like writing it right after brushing your teeth tomorrow morning?\nclient: I think setting it for right after brushing my teeth tomorrow morning would help me ease into the task without adding extra pressure tonight. That small routine connection could make it feel more manageable and build some needed momentum.\ntherapist: I'm glad we found a way to make the first step towards seeking support more manageable for you. Remember, it's all about taking small, gradual actions that build momentum over time. Good luck with drafting the email tomorrow morning, and feel free to reach out again if you need further assistance or guidance. Keep in mind that seeking support is a sign of strength and resilience, and you're taking important steps towards improving your well-being and academic success.\nclient: Thanks for the encouragement I'll give drafting that email a shot tomorrow morning to help me start tackling my overwhelming assignments without adding more stress. Take care.","completed":true}

The client has yet to make a strong commitment statement or articulate a solid plan to begin or sustain school attendance. Therefore, the Choosing phase objectives are not yet substantially met.\",\n  \"determination\": \"continue\"\n}","phase":"choosing"}],"dialogue_conv":"therapist: Hey there, how are you feeling today? Is there anything on your mind that you'd like to talk about?\nclient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed today with some decisions about my future. Yes, I'd like to talk about whether going back to school is feasible for me right now.\ntherapist: It sounds like you've got some big decisions on your mind. Navigating the future can be overwhelming, especially when it comes to something as significant as going back to school. What are some of the factors that are making you question whether it's feasible for you right now?\nclient: I'm worried about my financial situation and work schedule making it hard to balance with school, especially with family responsibilities like my kids. Plus, I'm concerned about staying motivated and avoiding burnout in a demanding routine.\ntherapist: That's a lot to consider. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Balancing school, work, finances, family, and self-care is a challenging task. Perhaps we can break these concerns down a bit. Which of these factors feels like the most pressing one for you right now?\nclient: The financial situation feels like the most pressing factor right now, as it directly impacts my ability to manage everything else. I'm also worried about how it might affect my family time and motivation to keep going.\ntherapist: It seems that your financial situation is causing significant stress and affecting your ability to manage multiple responsibilities. Exploring potential solutions and resources to alleviate some of these financial concerns might help you feel more in control. Can you tell me more about your current financial situation and how it might impact your decision to return to school?\nclient: I'm currently dealing with tight finances from high living costs and limited income, which makes it hard to cover everything without added stress. This situation is making me hesitant about returning to school, as I'm worried it would further strain my family time and overall motivation to keep up with everything.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're facing some difficult decisions, and it's important to consider the potential impact on your family time and motivation. Financial strain can certainly add to the stress of managing multiple responsibilities. Have you looked into any financial aid or scholarship opportunities that might help alleviate the burden of returning to school?\nclient: I've looked into some financial aid and scholarship options, but they don't seem to fully address my current constraints. This uncertainty is making me even more concerned about how adding school would affect my family time and overall energy.\ntherapist: It's understandable that financial uncertainty can add to the stress of managing multiple responsibilities. While financial aid and scholarships may not fully address your concerns, exploring alternative solutions might help ease some of the burdens. Have you considered part-time studies or online courses as a way to balance school with your work and family commitments?\nclient: I've considered part-time studies and online courses as options, but I'm concerned they might still strain my family time and energy due to my current financial and work demands. This makes me hesitant about whether they would truly help in the long run.\ntherapist: It seems like you're carefully weighing the pros and cons of various options, considering the potential impact on your family and personal well-being. It's important to make decisions that feel manageable and sustainable for you. Is there any additional support or resources you think might help alleviate some of these concerns and make the idea of returning to school more feasible?\nclient: I've considered seeking guidance from a financial counselor to better manage my budget and resources. Additionally, exploring flexible scheduling options through the school might help me maintain a balance with work and family commitments.\ntherapist: Seeking guidance from a financial counselor and exploring flexible scheduling options with the school seem like great steps towards addressing your concerns. It's important to remember that finding a balance between your responsibilities and personal well-being is key to making this decision. Would you like to discuss how these resources might be helpful in your specific situation?\nclient: Yes, I'd like to discuss how a financial counselor and flexible scheduling could help me manage my work and family commitments without adding too much strain. This might clarify if pursuing school is truly feasible for me right now.\ntherapist: Great! Let's start by talking about how a financial counselor can assist you. They can provide valuable guidance on budgeting and managing your resources effectively. This may help alleviate some of your financial concerns and create a clearer picture of what's financially feasible for you and your family. Additionally, they can offer advice on financial aid options and scholarships that could potentially ease the burden of tuition costs.\n\n That sounds helpful. Having a better understanding of my finances and the options available would definitely make it easier to see if going back to school is a viable choice. What about flexible scheduling?\n\n Flexible scheduling can be a great way to balance your work, family, and school commitments. Many schools offer options like part-time enrollment, online courses, or evening classes. These alternatives could allow you to continue working and spending time with your family while still pursuing your education. It's important to reach out to the school and discuss what options are available, so you can find a schedule that works best for you.\n\n I appreciate that. Knowing there are different scheduling options available makes the idea of returning to school less overwhelming. I'll look into these resources and see how they can help me make a more informed decision.\nclient: I appreciate the insights on scheduling options, as they could help me balance my work and family without overwhelming my daily routine. Still, I'm concerned about maintaining energy for everything, given my current commitments.\ntherapist: That's understandable. Juggling multiple responsibilities can be challenging, and it's essential to prioritize self-care to maintain your energy levels. Here are a few suggestions to consider\n\n- Create a schedule that includes dedicated time for relaxation and personal interests, ensuring you have moments to recharge.\n- Practice time-management techniques, such as prioritizing tasks and breaking larger projects into smaller, manageable steps.\n- Establish boundaries between your work, family, and school responsibilities to prevent one area from consuming all your energy.\n- Seek support from friends, family, or even a counselor to share your concerns and feelings, as they can provide valuable encouragement and advice.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to maintain a balance between your responsibilities and personal well-being to avoid burnout. Taking care of yourself will ultimately help you be more present and effective in each aspect of your life.\nclient: Thanks for the self-care suggestions they could help me manage my energy better. I'm still concerned about whether I'll sustain this balance with my current work and family demands while pursuing school.\ntherapist: It's natural to have these concerns, and it's important to remember that maintaining balance is an ongoing process. Here are some additional strategies to consider\n\n- Regularly reassess your priorities and commitments to ensure they align with your goals and values. This can help you make adjustments as needed.\n- Practice self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to not be perfect.

Still, I'm worried about whether I'll truly maintain this balance with my ongoing work and family obligations while adding school.\ntherapist: It's completely normal to have these lingering concerns. One way to address them is by establishing a plan to regularly check in with yourself and evaluate how you're managing your responsibilities.

Even with these, I'm still concerned about whether I'll realistically sustain this balance given my demanding work schedule and family commitments while pursuing school.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you have these concerns, and it's essential to acknowledge that managing multiple responsibilities can be challenging. Here are a few additional suggestions to help you navigate these challenges\n\n- Communicate openly with your employer about your educational goals and explore the possibility of flexible scheduling or reduced workload during your studies.\n- Discuss your plans with your family and work together to develop a support system that allows you to allocate dedicated time for your studies while still being present for your loved ones.\n- Consider online or hybrid learning options that may offer more flexibility in scheduling and allow you to complete coursework at times that work best for you.\n- Prioritize self-care and stress management techniques, such as exercise, meditation, or hobbies, to help maintain your well-being and energy levels.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be proactive in addressing potential challenges and to be willing to make adjustments as needed.

Your unique combination of skills, experiences, and perspectives, including your volunteering background, can bring a valuable perspective to the field. It's also worth noting that many successful professionals in psychology come from diverse backgrounds and experiences. Building on your strengths and finding ways to apply them in your academic and professional pursuits can help you carve out your own path in the field. Have you considered ways in which your volunteering experience might be integrated into your future psychology career or academic journey?\nclient: I've thought about using my volunteering experience to pursue related internships or research opportunities in psychology, which could help build my resume. However, I'm still unsure if that will be enough to make me stand out in such a competitive field.\ntherapist: Pursuing internships or research opportunities related to your volunteering experience is an excellent idea. These opportunities can not only enhance your resume but also provide valuable hands-on experience and networking connections. While it's normal to have doubts about standing out in a competitive field, remember that every step you take contributes to your growth and development as a professional. Instead of focusing on the end goal of standing out, consider embracing the journey of learning and growth. Have you thought about reaching out to professionals in the field who might offer guidance on how to best leverage your unique background and experiences?\nclient: I've considered reaching out to professionals for guidance on leveraging my background, but I'm worried it might not be enough to help me stand out. Still, I'm open to trying it as a way to build more confidence in my path forward.\ntherapist: Reaching out to professionals can be a valuable way to gain insights and guidance, even if it may not provide a definitive solution. Remember that building confidence in your path forward is a process, and each step, including seeking guidance, contributes to that process. When you're ready, consider compiling a list of professionals whose work aligns with your interests, and think about specific questions you'd like to ask them about leveraging your background. Which professionals would you consider contacting, and what questions might you ask to help you gain clarity on your path?\nclient: I might consider contacting my psychology professors or alumni from my university who have gone into the field, as they could relate to my experiences. I'd ask them about specific strategies to highlight my unique background in applications and how they overcame similar doubts to succeed in their careers.\ntherapist: It's great to see that you have a plan in place to reach out to professionals for guidance. Remember that your unique experiences and background can be an asset in your journey, and seeking advice from those who have been in your position can provide valuable insights. Stay committed to your path and continue taking steps towards building your confidence and resilience. Keep in mind that it's natural to have doubts, but each step you take brings you closer to your goals. I encourage you to follow through with your plan and reach out to your professors and alumni. Good luck, and feel free to provide updates on your progress during our next contact. Let's schedule a follow-up in about a month to check in on your progress and discuss any new developments or concerns you may have.\nclient: Thank you, I'll reach out to my professors and alumni as planned, even though my doubts about standing out still linger. I'll look forward to our follow-up in a month to share how it's going.","completed":true}

I joined my sorority during informal recruitment my sophomore year (last spring) and never really became close with anyone. I studied abroad last semester (maybe a bad idea in hindsight) and now it seems like I’m being excluded out of malicious intent. Yesterday was the cherry on top. Not gonna go into detail, but I went to an event and spoke to absolutely no one in my chapter. I feel like everyone hates me. It does take me a long time to warm up to people because I was severely bullied and abused K-12, and I wish with everything in me that I could fix it. After the event, I sobbed in my car while taking to my mom for an hour. I don’t want to bring the chapter down anymore. The only reason why I’m still in it is because it looks good on resumes.

Is there anything you'd like to talk about? I'm all ears and ready to listen.\nclient: Yes, I'd like to talk about the uncertainty I'm facing with my choices. It's been really weighing on me and affecting my daily life.\ntherapist: Uncertainty can be really challenging to deal with. It sounds like it's causing you a lot of distress. Can you tell me more about the choices you're facing?\n Sure. I'm trying to decide whether to stay in my current job or pursue a new career path. On one hand, my current job provides stability and a steady income. But on the other hand, I feel like I'm not growing or being challenged. I'm afraid of making the wrong decision and regretting it later.\nclient: I'm struggling to decide on a major or course of study because I'm interested in multiple areas and worried about making the wrong choice. My past academic performance is adding to the pressure, making me fear that any decision might not lead to the growth I want.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to make the \"right\" choice, and that can be really overwhelming. It's understandable that you want to make a decision that will lead to growth and fulfillment, but it's also important to remember that there is no one \"right\" path in life. Have you considered exploring your interests through internships or part-time work to get a better sense of what you might enjoy doing long-term?\nclient: I haven't really explored internships or part-time work yet because the uncertainty about my interests is making it hard to take that step. I'm worried that trying something new might just add to the pressure from my past academic struggles.\ntherapist: It's understandable that uncertainty can make it difficult to take the first step. However, sometimes, exploring different opportunities can actually help reduce uncertainty by giving you a better sense of what you enjoy and what you don't. Have you considered talking to a career counselor or mentor who could help guide you through this process?\nclient: I haven't spoken to a career counselor or mentor yet, as the thought of more guidance feels overwhelming amid my uncertainty. I'm concerned it might not ease the pressure from my past experiences and could leave me feeling even more stuck.\ntherapist: It seems like the fear of making the wrong choice and the pressure you're feeling is holding you back from seeking help or exploring new opportunities. However, remember that it's completely normal to feel uncertain about your career path, and many people go through similar struggles. It might be helpful to take small steps towards exploring your interests, such as talking to people in different professions or reading about various career paths, without putting too much pressure on yourself to make a decision right away. Is there a small step you could take to start exploring your options?\nclient: I could start by reading about a few career paths online that interest me, like through articles or videos, to get a low-pressure sense of what's out there. However, I'm still worried that even this might remind me of my past struggles and add to my stress if it doesn't clarify things quickly.\ntherapist: That sounds like a great first step, and it's important to remember that gaining clarity takes time. It's natural to feel some stress during this process, but by approaching it in small, manageable steps, you can minimize the pressure you put on yourself. It might also be helpful to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to feel uncertain or make mistakes along the way. Is there anything you can do to take care of yourself and manage stress as you start exploring your options?\nclient: I could try practicing mindfulness through short meditation sessions or journaling to help calm my mind. I'm hoping this will ease the pressure from my ongoing uncertainties without overwhelming me further.\ntherapist: Practicing mindfulness through meditation and journaling are great ways to manage stress and reduce pressure. By focusing on the present moment and observing your thoughts without judgment, you can develop a more accepting and compassionate relationship with yourself, which can be particularly helpful during times of uncertainty. Do you have any experience with mindfulness or meditation, or would you like some suggestions on how to get started?\nclient: I've dabbled in meditation a few times during high school but often felt too overwhelmed by my uncertainties to continue. I'd appreciate some straightforward suggestions to ease into it without heightening my stress.\ntherapist: It's understandable that starting a new practice like meditation can feel overwhelming, especially when you're already dealing with uncertainties. One approach that might help is to start with short, guided meditations that focus on relaxation and stress relief. There are several apps available that offer beginner-friendly meditations, such as Headspace or Calm. You can start with just a few minutes each day and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable. Additionally, journaling about your uncertainties and reflecting on your thoughts and emotions can help you process them more effectively. Remember, the goal is not to eliminate uncertainty or stress entirely, but to develop healthier ways to cope with them. How do you feel about trying these suggestions?\nclient: I think trying these suggestions feels like a good, low-pressure start to managing my overwhelming uncertainties. I'm open to giving them a go, hoping it helps me make decisions without adding more stress.\ntherapist: It's great that you're willing to try these suggestions and approach your uncertainties with self-compassion. Remember that it's okay to take small steps and give yourself time to explore your interests and options.

Its great to have you here. Is there something on your mind youd like to talk about today?\nclient: Yes, I've been feeling anxious about handling presentations. I'd like to talk about ways to manage my nerves and build confidence.\ntherapist: It sounds like presentations can be a nerve-wracking experience for you. That's completely understandable. Let's explore what specifically about presentations triggers your anxiety and how we can work on managing those feelings. Would you like to share more about what happens when you're preparing for or giving a presentation?\nclient: Yes, I get really nervous during presentations, with physical symptoms like stuttering and a racing heart. I'm hoping to find healthier ways to handle that anxiety instead of relying on temporary fixes.\ntherapist: It's clear that your physical symptoms of anxiety are really impacting your experience during presentations. It's great that you're seeking healthier ways to cope with these feelings. Let's start by understanding the root of your anxiety around presentations. Is there a specific aspect of presenting that triggers these feelings for you, like the fear of judgment from others or worry about making mistakes?\nclient: Yes, the fear of judgment from others is a big trigger for me, especially when I worry about making mistakes. I'm eager to explore strategies that can help me build confidence without relying on unhelpful habits.\ntherapist: It's great that you're recognizing the connection between your fear of judgment and your anxiety around making mistakes. Let's explore some strategies to help you build confidence and manage your anxiety more effectively. Have you tried any techniques like deep breathing exercises or visualization to help calm your nerves before a presentation?\nclient: I haven't really tried deep breathing exercises or visualization techniques before, as I've mostly relied on other methods in the past. I'm interested in exploring these to see if they can help me feel more confident during presentations.\ntherapist: That's great! Deep breathing exercises and visualization can be powerful tools to manage anxiety. Let's start by discussing a simple deep breathing technique called \"4-7-8\" that you can practice before your next presentation. It involves inhaling for a count of 4, holding your breath for 7, and then exhaling for 8. This helps to activate your body's relaxation response and can reduce feelings of anxiety. Are you open to giving this technique a try?\nclient: Yes, I'm open to trying the 4-7-8 breathing technique. I hope it helps me build the confidence I need for presentations.\ntherapist: Great! Here's a step-by-step guide to the 4-7-8 breathing technique\n\n1. Find a comfortable and quiet place to sit or lie down.\n2. Close your eyes and focus on your breath.\n3. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, counting to 4 as you breathe in.\n4. Hold your breath for a count of 7.\n5. Exhale slowly through your mouth, counting to 8 as you breathe out.\n6. Repeat the cycle of inhaling, holding, and exhaling for 3-4 minutes.\n\nTry practicing this technique daily, and gradually work your way up to using it before your presentations. Remember, it's a skill that gets easier with practice, so be patient and kind to yourself as you learn.\nclient: I'll start practicing the 4-7-8 breathing technique daily as you described. I hope it helps me feel more prepared and less anxious for my upcoming presentations.\ntherapist: That's a great plan! To track your progress, consider keeping a journal or using a mood-tracking app to record your anxiety levels before and after practicing the 4-7-8 technique. This can help you see the improvements you're making and motivate you to continue practicing. Are there any specific times of the day you plan to dedicate to this practice?\nclient: I plan to practice the 4-7-8 breathing technique in the mornings before my classes and in the evenings before bed. This timing should help me build up my confidence gradually for upcoming presentations.\ntherapist: It's wonderful to see your commitment to practicing the 4-7-8 breathing technique.

{"id":"10yqi80","timestamp":1675987200000,"category":"school_life","concern":"TLDR: How feasible is it to switch from a humanities major like the undermentioned to a science major like biology\/biochem, especially in the first 2 years of college?\n\nHere's a bit on my situation:\n\nI am a high school senior with many broad interests. My favorite classes at school have always been bio\/chem and English, although I've loved every subject I've taken (excluding a bad experience with physics). While my peers were deciding what major\/specialization to apply for, I was still trying to decide between STEM and the humanities. Ultimately, I chose to apply for business and social science programs (e.g. intl relations, economics, psychology).\n\nI did this because I felt the opportunity cost of choosing STEM was greater than choosing a humanities-based major, as creativity\/eloquence are my strengths and public speaking is a passion of mine.

Whats on your mind today? Im here to listen and offer support.\nclient: I'm feeling really overwhelmed with my schoolwork lately and it's affecting my confidence. I want to figure out how to manage this stress better.\ntherapist: That sounds like a lot to deal with! It's totally understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Schoolwork can be a lot to handle, especially when it starts to impact your confidence. Let's explore this a bit further. What specific aspects of your schoolwork are causing you the most stress?\nclient: I'm mostly stressed about the gap between my study efforts and my actual exam results, which is shaking my confidence in preparing effectively. It's also making me anxious about upcoming assessments and how to improve without knowing what's going wrong.\ntherapist: It's really tough when you're putting in the effort but not seeing the results you want. That can definitely shake your confidence and leave you feeling unsure about how to move forward. It's important to remember that everyone learns and processes information differently, and there might be some adjustments you can make to your study habits that could help bridge that gap. Have you tried any different study techniques or strategies lately, or is there anything you think might be worth trying?\nclient: I haven't really tried any new study techniques lately, as I've been sticking to what worked for me before. I think experimenting with things like practice exams or study groups might be worth trying to see if that helps bridge the gap.\ntherapist: It's great that you're open to trying new strategies! Experimenting with different techniques like practice exams or study groups can indeed give you insights into what works best for you. As you consider these options, which one do you feel might be the most beneficial for you to try first?\nclient: I think practice exams would be the most beneficial to try first, as they might help me better assess my real understanding. I'm hoping this approach could rebuild some of that lost confidence before the finals.\ntherapist: That sounds like a great plan! To get started, would you prefer to look for practice exams online or ask your professors if they have any available resources?\nclient: I think looking for practice exams online would be easier for me to start with, as it's quick and accessible. This could help me gauge my understanding without added pressure right away.\ntherapist: It's encouraging to see you taking initiative to improve your study habits and regain confidence. Starting with online practice exams is a great first step, as it allows you to assess your understanding at your own pace. Remember, it's important to be patient with yourself during this process and celebrate the progress you make along the way. Good luck with your practice exams, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further support. Let's plan to check in after a week to see how this new approach is working for you.\nclient: Thanks for the encouragementI'll start with those online practice exams and plan to check in next week, even though I'm still feeling pretty discouraged about turning things around for finals.\ntherapist: It's understandable to feel discouraged, but remember that progress takes time, and even small steps can lead to significant improvements.

{"id":"10s4sht","timestamp":1675296000000,"category":"emotional","concern":"Up until this past weekend, I lived on campus with my girlfriend and a couple of roommates.  Unfortunately, one of my roommates died in her bedroom over the weekend.  She was an older student with a bunch of health issues, and had temporarily died\/had serious medical emergencies many times in the apartment previously.  These situations got to be so stressful that me, my girlfriend, and our other roommate have been going to therapy appointments on campus to try and process everything, and I fell behind on my classes. The other roommates and I had raised concerns to the housing department about living with her, the stress we were under being in this situation, and feeling like we were medically responsible for her.  The college said we were not responsible for her, but their actions and things they’ve said behind our backs say otherwise.  For example, my roommate who passed away and my girlfriend were relocated to temporary housing before finals due to a pipe burst; the roommate later told me and my girlfriend that the assistant director of housing called her and asked if anyone was staying with her that night, as she (assistant director) was uncomfortable with her living someplace by herself (my girlfriend had decided to not stay in the temporary housing). Roommate’s husband was staying with her that night on a visit, which was satisfactory to the assistant director.  The college as a whole had told us multiple times prior to our roommate dying that they were working on a solution, but nothing happened until after she died. When she was alive, we were only asked once to provide input about what we wanted to have happen and were told in that meeting it was best for her to stay living with us because if they moved her to a different apartment she would traumatize more students.  Housing also said they were uncomfortable moving the rest of us to different apartments because then our roommate would be alone and no one would be able to call for medical assistance if she needed it, and that they couldn’t kick her out of housing just because she had health issues.  After months of getting run around by housing and other departments, my roommate died in the apartment, and the school hasn’t done anything to help the rest of us deal with the past few months beyond telling us sorry that she died, telling us that counseling exists, and moving me and my girlfriend into a new apartment.  I’m very frustrated that I was put into and forced to stay in this situation for as long as I was. Surely there were things the college could have done to let my roommate stay living on campus while making sure she was staying safe (letting her have a care attendant or having her live with an RA are two options that come to mind).  My parents are saying legal action is warranted in this situation and that I should try and get the school to reimburse my housing costs for the year, but I wanted to get some input from others before I decide what I’m going to do.  Is there anything I can or should reasonably ask my college to do to make up for me being kept this situation?

In fact, because I figured it out so late, I believe I learned a few things that I wished I had done before.\n\n1. Study for the LSAT as soon as you can. Learning the test is a process because it is unlike any test you have had to take academically or standardized. The earlier you start, the more chance you give yourself to figure out your weaknesses and study over time without having to put as much pressure on yourself. I started late and did not do as well as I believe I could have.\n2. No matter what size your school is, try and get to know at least 2 professors on a personal level. Having professors help you with course selection and academic advice is useful for college itself, however, you will need LOR in the future and having professors that know your academic strengths and you as a person will help them write a more impressive LOR.\n3. Take classes that may expose you to the law to see if you are interested. People go to law school with a variety of different academic backgrounds, however most people get some electives that they can take. My suggestion is to take a constitutional law class, which although is not exactly same as what you will do in law school, it will introduce you to cases and concepts that will inform you of your interest in the topic. It will also prepare you for how to read court cases which may be difficult in the beginning.\n\nHope this helps, feel free to comment more tips if anyone has any.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome, I'm here to listen and understand.

Ideally, I would just prevent it, but sometimes it’s inevitable. Stomach bugs cause some really nasty symptoms, and if there’s any kind of accident, it is going to be difficult to clean in a dorm.\n\nMy dorms have one toilet and one shower for the ENTIRE HALL. Technically, we have 2 of each, but the locks have been removed. They have also taken away every single paper towel machine on campus, so there is no easy access to paper towels.\n\nI know my question is gross, but how do you deal with a stomach bug in this situation? What if you throw up but miss the toilet? What if the bathroom is occupied but you NEED to go? At home, it would be easy to clean up, disinfect, and dispose of soiled towels or wipes. Not here. Sometimes these bugs have people having diarrhea and throwing up at the same time, so a huge mess is guaranteed in that situation. That’s a big mess that there is no way to clean up, not to mention, really embarrassing.\n\nI can’t find anything to answer my question online. I’m sorry, I know this is gross. Is there anything you guys would recommend having around, or advice on how you managed having a bad stomach bug in dorms?

Try to shift your focus to your personal growth and celebrate the small victories along the way.\nclient: I understand the importance of focusing on my own progress and celebrating small wins. It's still challenging to maintain that focus when external successes make my educational path feel less rewarding.\ntherapist: One strategy could be setting specific, achievable goals related to your education and tracking your progress. This might help you stay motivated by providing visible markers of your own growth. Would you prefer creating weekly or monthly milestones to monitor your academic achievements?\nclient: I think weekly milestones would be more manageable for me, as they could help me see progress more frequently. It's still tough to stay motivated when friends are moving ahead financially, but I'll try to focus on these smaller goals to keep going.\ntherapist: It's great that you're willing to try this approach. Remember, your education is a long-term investment in yourself, and its value may not be immediately apparent. Keep working towards your weekly milestones, and don't hesitate to reach out to your support network when you need encouragement. I'll check in with you in a week to see how you're doing.\nclient: I'll give the weekly milestones a shot to keep myself on track, even though it's hard seeing my friends advance financially while I'm still building my future. Thanks for the supporttalk to you next week.","completed":true}

I am doing so horrible and on the verge of flunking and this is my first semester. I have an associates in applied science and my whole job experience is medical related. Idk if it’s the frustration and defeating talking but seeing what nurses are responsible and in charge of is making me rethink my whole career plan. I thought this is what I wanted but now I’m having second thoughts, I feel like I’m too old to change career paths and even if I wanted to I have zero experience in other departments. I have kids and shit to maintain so I can’t just keep taking classes unless they are gonna help me excel. Idk what to do, I’ve never felt like this before. On one hand if I become a nurse there are so many different departments you can get into, but on the other hand idk if I’m telling myself that as comfort because I’m too scared to admit it’s not what I want.

I am currently planning to go to community college, as it works the best for me financially and in regards to my major. I am planning to move out, but there's going to be a lot in my plate. I need to move out - I have many problems with my family and cannot get anything done in this house because of the traumas and abuse I've experienced here. I'm planning to double major in either Music Preformance and Music Education, or Music Preformance and Political Science. In both these fields, connections and relationships are extremely important, so I was hoping to get a job related to my music field and an internship related to political science. I already have availabilities with the internships, but my main concern is if I will be able to do it all. I don't really have anyone who I can ask and has gone through this experience. Will moving out, double majoring, working, and having an internship be too much to handle? I'm very independent and I'm hoping to get a couple roommates (i don't understand how renting apartments work but I'll do research).

I have always hoped he could come with me but I think ive always known deep down he was never going to. I dont usually pour my feelings out on social media but when he brought this up to me, I felt so much anger and frustration and sadness and pain. I can't imagine leaving him behind after he has provided such a comfortable life for me, not to mention my pets and sister who is still with my mom. I feel so distraught when I think about leaving all by myself because I had always hoped I could have my best friend come with me. I'm so scared that we will drift apart, even though we have been friends all throughout middle and highschool. I dont really have any other friends, maybe a few coworkers I talk to at work, but he is the only person I can say is genuinely close to me. I worry I wont bond with anyone like I did him when I leave for college and will only remain close acquaintances with potential college friends. Everywhere I look online I see the same things about taking opportunities to meet new people and not dwell on past relationships, staying in touch when you have time, but the thought alone makes me so incredibly upset. I haven't even applied to any of my dream colleges yet and im sitting here crying thinking about the outcomes, even though I dont know if I will even get in or attend these colleges until the fall. Im so angry and upset that he won't come with me but at the same time Im so upset at the thought that I will miss him terribly. Part of me feels like losing touch is inevitable and I dont know how to handle it. He and his family has done so much for me and to just move on and forget that feels so wrong. Before we started living together, I felt so incredibly alone and I dont want to feel so isolated again. Im coping terribly at the thought alone and I have no clue how i'll even manage to cope.

Can you tell me a bit more about what's going on?\nclient: I'm feeling really torn about pursuing my dream of attending a musical theatre college out of state, mainly because it involves leaving my best friend behind. This is making me anxious about losing that close connection and ending up feeling isolated again.\ntherapist: Its clear that your friendship is incredibly important to you. At the same time, it sounds like youre worried about missing out on your dream if you stay. Its tough to be caught between two things that matter so much.\nclient: Yes, it's incredibly difficult to weigh my dream against the risk of losing my closest friendship. I keep worrying that pursuing this path will leave me feeling isolated all over again, even though I know it's what I want deep down.\ntherapist: It's natural to feel conflicted when faced with a decision like this. It takes courage to pursue your dreams, but it's also important to consider the impact on your relationships. Perhaps we can explore ways to maintain your connection with your best friend while still pursuing your passion?\nclient: I appreciate the idea of finding ways to stay connected, but I'm really worried that distance will make our friendship fade no matter what we try. It's hard for me to imagine building that same level of closeness with anyone else if I go.\ntherapist: It's understandable that the thought of losing such a valuable connection is causing you anxiety. However, it's worth considering that strong friendships can endure distance and change if both parties are willing to put in effort. Would you like to discuss some strategies that might help maintain your bond, even if you choose to attend the out-of-state college?\nclient: Yes, I'd like to discuss some strategies for maintaining my friendship. I'm just worried that even with effort, the distance might still lead to us growing apart and leaving me feeling isolated again.\ntherapist: Let's start by exploring communication methods that can help you stay connected with your friend, such as scheduling regular video calls or virtual hangouts. Consistency in communication can help maintain the closeness you value in your friendship.\n\n That's a good idea. I think we could commit to weekly video calls and maybe even watch movies or shows together online. I'm still worried though, that it won't be the same as being in person.\n\n It's true that virtual interactions can't fully replace in-person experiences, but they can help bridge the distance. Another idea is to plan visits during breaks or long weekends, giving you both something to look forward to and an opportunity to spend time together in person.\n\n I like the idea of planning visits, and I think we could make that work. I guess I'm just scared that our lives will change so much that we won't be able to relate to each other anymore.\nclient: I appreciate the suggestion of planning visits, as it could help keep our connection alive. Still, I'm worried that our diverging paths in life might make it difficult to maintain that same level of understanding and closeness we have now.\ntherapist: It's natural to be concerned about how life changes might affect your friendship. However, remember that true friends can grow and evolve together, even if their paths diverge. It might require extra effort and understanding, but the bond you've built can serve as a strong foundation for adapting to these changes. Would you like to discuss ways to embrace and support each other's growth while maintaining your connection?\nclient: Yes, I'd like to discuss ways to embrace and support each other's growth while staying connected. I'm concerned that the changes in our lives might make it hard to keep that deep bond intact.\ntherapist: One approach could be openly discussing your fears and expectations about how your friendship might evolve. By acknowledging these concerns together, you can establish a mutual understanding and create a plan for maintaining your bond. This can also help foster a sense of trust and vulnerability, which can strengthen your connection.\n\n It sounds like a good idea to have an open conversation about our worries and expectations. I think it would be helpful for both of us to share our thoughts and come up with a plan together. I'm still a bit scared, but I know we care about each other, and that's a good starting point.\n\n Absolutely, having that open communication can help you both navigate the changes and reassure each other of your commitment to the friendship. Additionally, you can find new ways to bond over shared interests or experiences, even if they're different from what you've done in the past. This can help create a sense of excitement and growth within your friendship.\n\n That's true finding new shared interests could be a fun way to keep our bond strong. Maybe we could even start a book club or watch new shows together to discuss. I'm still anxious about the situation, but I feel a bit better knowing that we can work on this together.\nclient: That's a helpful reminder about finding new ways to connect it gives me hope that we can adapt and keep our friendship evolving. Even so, I'm still worried that the distance might slowly erode the closeness we've shared for so long.\ntherapist: Acknowledge the client's concerns and suggest exploring the idea of scheduling regular virtual hangouts or phone calls, ensuring consistent communication and a sense of closeness, even from a distance.\n\n That's a good idea. Setting up regular virtual hangouts or phone calls might help us feel more connected. I'll bring it up when we discuss our expectations and make a plan together.\n\n Encourage the client to consider that maintaining friendships can be challenging, but with effort and open communication, it's possible to preserve the bond they've built with their friend.\n\n You're right, it won't be easy, but I believe our friendship is worth the effort.

I’m not happy in my current research lab, the research doesn’t interest me and I don’t feel passionate about it. I’d been here for a semester (previous semester) and realized how I took this lab in a rush because I’d just left my previous lab due to having a toxic PI. I will be talking to my current PI about wanting to leave, and now have a direction of my true passion\/research interests (microbio and immuno). I reached out to PIs of interest in this department and so far, 4 have said that they’re full and to come back in the summer, while 3 offered me interviews.. I spoke with my mentor in my research program and she told me how 2 out of those three are poor mentors and I would be sucked dry with the hours they’ll give me, while she doesn’t know anything about the third. I will be meeting with them to gage, but I feel that my options so far are limited. There’s still more PIs to hear from that haven’t responded, but I’m at a loss on what to do… Should I start this semester or wait in the summer to increase my options? I’m thinking about responding to those who replied with a request to rotate, I really want to be in a good lab environment. With this said, I will be leaving current lab irrespective of whether I start a new lab for this semester or not. Another thing is I’m not sure how to go about the PIs who haven’t responded yet, I understand that they’re EXTREMELY busy, but alot of the times they don’t see the students’ email because of the sheer volume of emails they have. How long do I give it before I email again (if, at all?) for context, I emailed this past Thursday\/Friday, which I know is SO RECENT, but just for a rule o thumb.

{"id":"1ep780x","timestamp":1723334400000,"category":"emotional","concern":"TW for mention of sexual assault\n\nMy intro to psychology class is online through a program called OLI where our instructor assigns us 3-4 modules a week to read and then take quizzes on. The past two weeks, two separate modules have had a short section at the beginning where it's a story from someone. Only three out of 19 modules have had these stories added to them, and two of them were about violent SA. Both of these triggered me and caused me to have to take breaks from my work due to past trauma that I'm currently in therapy for.\n\nThe first one was a woman talking about her PTSD from a violent sexual assault, how she'll never be the same but found treatment. This was at the beginning of a chapter about classical conditioning terminology and specifically Pavlov's dogs.\n\nThe second one was another woman talking about her violent assault and how she caused a man to be wrongfully convicted for 11 years because of source monitoring. This led into a chapter about source monitoring and memory, which is admittedly more relevant to the curriculum than the previous one.\n\nI have went through filing an official grievance complaint about a previous online class and instructor before and it took a mental toll on me so I'm on the fence about reporting something like that again. I'm also stuck on whether or not it's valid to be triggered by this because I hear people say that the world isn't responsible for my triggers, I'm responsible for learning how to cope with them (which I do but still think TW are helpful, harm reducing and kind). I just think it's unnecessary to use these types of stories when it could be conveyed with something less graphic and more relevant to the curriculum. Is it worth going to the teacher about and expressing TW could be useful in the future?\n\nedit: I've had an instructor in the past put trigger warnings on their assignments very diligently, and tell us that if we're uncomfortable with the material to come to them and they'd figure something else out. Also encouraged us to leave class if we were uncomfortable or triggered with discussions.\n\nedit2: I also go to a VERY small community college. All classes have 15 people at most, usually less.

This way, you can clearly communicate your needs while also demonstrating your commitment to succeeding in the course. Do you think this could be a helpful way to facilitate the conversation?\nclient: Yes, I think preparing a list would help me approach the conversation with more confidence and clarity. It aligns with my goal of advocating for a supportive learning environment while maintaining my personal comfort.\ntherapist: It seems you have a clear plan in place to address your concerns. Incorporating self-care practices into your routine will help you maintain emotional balance, and preparing a list of specific concerns will make it easier for you to communicate with your professor. I encourage you to take these steps and observe the positive impact they have on your well-being and academic experience. Remember that you can always revisit and adjust your approach as needed. I wish you the best of luck, and feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.\nclient: I'll definitely incorporate self-care and prepare that list to address my class concerns more effectively, and I appreciate the support as I move forward. Thank you for the session.","completed":true}

It might be worth trying these options, as they could offer valuable support in building your confidence and reducing your academic stress. Have you considered speaking with your professor or teaching assistant about your concerns and seeking guidance on how to approach these challenging concepts?\nclient: Yes, I've considered speaking with my professor or teaching assistant about my concerns. However, I'm still unsure if that would fully alleviate my doubts about truly grasping the material.\ntherapist: It's natural to feel uncertain about whether seeking guidance from your professor or teaching assistant will completely resolve your concerns.

Remember, building confidence and reducing academic stress is a process, and each step you take contributes to your overall progress. Are there any specific questions or concerns you'd like to address when speaking with your professor or teaching assistant?\nclient: I'm concerned about discussing my gaps in understanding key concepts like cache memory and pipelining, which might be why my exam scores aren't reflecting my efforts. I'd also like to ask for strategies to build confidence in my ability to truly master the material.\ntherapist: When speaking with your professor or teaching assistant, it's important to be open and honest about the areas where you feel less confident, such as cache memory and pipelining. They can provide guidance and resources tailored to your specific needs, which may help bridge the gap between your efforts and exam scores. Additionally, discussing strategies for building confidence in your ability to master the material can be beneficial. Remember, they are there to support your learning journey. Would you find it helpful to prepare a list of specific questions or concerns before your meeting to ensure you cover all the essential topics?\nclient: Yes, preparing a list of specific questions would help me approach the meeting more organized and address my uncertainties effectively. It could also give me a clearer path to building the confidence I need in mastering the material.\ntherapist: That's a great idea. By organizing your thoughts and questions, you'll be able to make the most of your meeting and address your concerns more efficiently. To start, try writing down the key concepts you're struggling with, like cache memory and pipelining, and formulate questions that could help clarify your understanding. Additionally, consider asking for recommendations on supplemental resources or study techniques that might help you gain confidence in your ability to master the material. Would you like to share some of the questions you plan to ask during your meeting, so we can discuss any potential adjustments or additions?\nclient: Yes, I'd be open to sharing a couple of questions I've prepared, as it might help refine them to better address my uncertainties. This could assist in strengthening my confidence in grasping the material more effectively.\ntherapist: Great, I'm glad to hear that you're open to sharing your questions. Remember, the more specific your questions are, the more helpful your professor or teaching assistant can be in addressing your uncertainties. Feel free to share a couple of them now, and we can discuss any adjustments or additions that might further clarify your concerns. Also, keep in mind that building confidence is a process, and each step you take, like preparing these questions, contributes to your growth and understanding of the material.\nclient: I appreciate the advice on making my questions more specificI'll share one like, \"How can I better understand cache memory hierarchies to improve my exam scores?\" For now, I'm feeling more prepared to move forward on my own.\ntherapist: It sounds like you've made some progress in identifying strategies to manage your academic stress and improve your understanding of challenging topics. Remember to keep utilizing the resources available to you, such as meeting with your professor or teaching assistant and seeking additional study materials. Building confidence takes time, but each step you take brings you closer to your goals. Feel free to reach out again if you need further support or guidance.

As you start building your schedule, remember to also consider setting aside some time for self-care and relaxation. This can help prevent burnout and keep you feeling your best. Do you have any ideas for how you might incorporate self-care into your routine?\nclient: I could try incorporating short daily walks or meditation sessions into my evenings to help me unwind. This might allow me to recharge and maintain balance with my other commitments.\ntherapist: That's a wonderful idea! Taking time for self-care activities like walks or meditation can be incredibly beneficial for your overall well-being and help you stay balanced. As you create your schedule, try to be consistent with your self-care time, making it a priority just like your work and classes. This will help ensure you're taking care of yourself and feeling more in control of your routine. Would you like to start building your schedule today and see how it feels?\nclient: Yes, I'd like to start building my schedule today to see how it fits. This could help me better manage my time and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\ntherapist: Excellent! Starting today will give you a head start in managing your time effectively. To make the process more manageable, you might consider breaking down your schedule into smaller tasks, such as adding classes first, then work hours, and finally self-care activities. This can help you focus on one aspect at a time and make adjustments as needed. Which part of your schedule would you like to tackle first?\nclient: I'd like to tackle the classes first. This will help me organize my time around them effectively.\ntherapist: Great! Starting with your classes is an excellent way to build your schedule. Once you've organized your classes, we can move on to incorporating your work hours and self-care activities. Remember, it's essential to maintain a balance between your responsibilities and personal well-being. After you've made some progress with your schedule, feel free to reach out and let me know how it's going. I'm here to support you in creating a routine that works best for you. Good luck, and remember to take it one step at a time!\nclient: Thank you for the guidance I'll start with my classes and make sure to fit in my 3 or 4 work days without overloading myself. I'll reach out if I need more help.\ntherapist: It's been a pleasure working with you on creating a balanced schedule. Remember to take it one step at a time, and feel free to reach out for additional support whenever needed. I'm here to help you maintain a healthy balance between your work, school, and self-care activities.

I'm here to listen and help you explore your thoughts and feelings.\nclient: I'm feeling really disappointed because my high expectations about professors in college aren't matching up with reality. I'm hoping to explore ways to manage these feelings and shift my perspective.\ntherapist: That sounds really tough, especially when you've been looking forward to this experience. It's natural to feel disappointed when things don't meet our expectations. Let's talk through what's been happening and see if we can find some ways to help you cope with these feelings and maybe reframe your perspective a bit. What specifically has been different than what you expected?\nclient: I've found that professors are coming across as more distant and unsupportive than I expected them to be. This has left me feeling more disillusioned and unsure about my college experience.\ntherapist: It's definitely tough to feel like the people who are supposed to be supporting and guiding you are distant and unsupportive. That can be really disheartening, especially when you're in a new environment like college. It's understandable that you're feeling disillusioned. Have you had any positive interactions with professors, or is it a consistent pattern across the board?\nclient: I've mostly experienced professors as distant and unsupportive, with very few positive interactions so far. This pattern has made it hard to shake off my initial disappointment in how things are turning out.\ntherapist: It's completely valid to feel disappointed and frustrated when your expectations aren't met, especially in a new environment like college. It's important to acknowledge those feelings, but also consider how you might adapt and make the most of your experience despite these challenges. Have you thought about any ways you could potentially approach your professors or seek additional support from other sources on campus?\nclient: I've thought about approaching my professors, but I'm hesitant given how distant they've felt so far. I've also considered seeking support from other campus resources, like student advisors or peer groups, to help navigate this.\ntherapist: It's great that you're considering seeking support from other resources on campus. Student advisors and peer groups can offer valuable guidance and perspectives that may help you navigate these challenges. They might also provide insights into how to approach your professors effectively or suggest alternative ways to build connections with them. It's important to remember that you're not alone in this, and there are people and resources available to help you make the most of your college experience. Would you like to explore these options further and discuss how you might take those initial steps?\nclient: I'm open to discussing how to take those initial steps with campus resources, as I'm hoping it might help me feel less isolated. Still, I'm hesitant about engaging with professors given my experiences so far.\ntherapist: It's understandable to feel hesitant about engaging with professors, but remember that seeking support from other resources like student advisors or peer groups can help you navigate those interactions more effectively. It's important to take things at your own pace, so let's focus on exploring the initial steps you can take with campus resources. What do you think would be the best way for you to start seeking support from student advisors or peer groups?\nclient: I think starting with an appointment at the student advising center would be a good first step, as it feels less intimidating than approaching professors directly. Once I connect with peers in a group, I hope it could help me build confidence in handling those interactions without feeling so isolated.\ntherapist: That sounds like a great plan! Making an appointment at the student advising center is a proactive step toward finding the support you need. It's important to remember that they are there to help you navigate challenges and connect with resources that can improve your college experience. When do you think you'll schedule that appointment, and would you like any help preparing for it?\nclient: I'll probably schedule the appointment at the student advising center next week, as I want to ease into this without rushing. I could use some general tips on how to prepare, to help me feel more confident in seeking support amidst my uncertainties.\ntherapist: Great! Here are a few tips to help you prepare for your appointment at the student advising center\n\n1. Write down your concerns and specific questions beforehand, so you don't forget anything important.\n2. Reflect on your goals and what you hope to achieve by seeking support, as this will help guide the conversation.\n3. Remember that the advisors are there to help you, so be open and honest about your experiences and feelings.\n\nI'm glad you're taking this step to seek support, and I wish you all the best in your appointment. Remember, you can always reach out again if you need more assistance or guidance.\nclient: Thanks for the tips they'll help me feel more prepared to share my concerns about professors and find the support I need. I'll let you know how the appointment goes.","completed":true}

This can help build in some flexibility and alleviate pressure if unexpected challenges arise. Additionally, you could try scheduling regular breaks and self-care activities to help maintain a healthy balance and prevent burnout. How does this sound, and would you like to discuss any other strategies to help you feel more prepared?\nclient: This sounds helpful for managing my anxiety by adding flexibility and self-care to my plans, which could make the semester feel less daunting. Yes, I'd like to discuss other strategies to further prepare me for those uneasy required classes.\ntherapist: One additional strategy could be to connect with your professors or teaching assistants during their office hours to discuss your concerns and seek guidance on course expectations. They might offer valuable insights and resources to help you navigate the challenging aspects of the classes. Would you feel comfortable reaching out to them, and if so, what questions or topics would you like to address during these conversations?\nclient: I feel somewhat comfortable reaching out to professors or TAs, even though it adds to my pre-semester jitters. I'd like to ask about key course expectations and practical tips for handling the challenging material in those required classes.\ntherapist: It's great that you're considering reaching out to your professors and TAs. Remember, they are there to support your learning journey and help you succeed. To make the most of your conversations with them, prepare your questions in advance and take notes during the discussion. This will not only demonstrate your commitment to the course but also provide you with a helpful reference as you navigate the semester. Good luck, and remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. Let's plan to follow up in a month to discuss your progress and any additional support you may need.\nclient: Thank you for the advice I'll prepare for those conversations to ease my pre-semester nerves and handle the required classes better. I'm looking forward to our follow-up in a month.","completed":true}

Is there anything on your mind you'd like to talk about today? I'm all ears and ready to listen.\nclient: Yes, I'm feeling overwhelmed with my current class load and part-time job. I'm seeking advice on how to manage it better.\ntherapist: That sounds like a lot on your plate! Juggling school and work can be tough. Let's explore what's contributing to the overwhelm. Can you tell me more about your current schedule?\nclient: I'm taking a mix of classes that include some tougher ones along with a part-time job, which is adding to my stress. I'm hoping to find ways to better manage this workload without dropping anything yet.\ntherapist: That's a challenging situation, indeed! It's understandable that you're feeling stressed. Let's see if we can find some strategies to help you manage your workload. One approach could be prioritizing tasks and creating a schedule. Have you tried this before?\nclient: I've tried creating a basic schedule before, but it hasn't helped much with managing the overall stress. I'm open to learning better ways to prioritize effectively.\ntherapist: It's great that you're open to trying new strategies. One method that might be helpful is the Eisenhower Matrix, which focuses on prioritizing tasks based on their urgency and importance. Have you heard of this approach before?\n No, I haven't. Can you tell me more about the Eisenhower Matrix and how it could help me better manage my workload?\n Absolutely! The Eisenhower Matrix is a simple tool that helps you categorize tasks into four quadrants based on their urgency and importance. This allows you to prioritize tasks more effectively and allocate your time and energy accordingly. Let's discuss how you can implement this in your daily life.\n That sounds promising! I'm eager to learn more about the Eisenhower Matrix and how it can help me better manage my time and reduce stress. Can we discuss how to apply this method to my specific situation?\nclient: That sounds like a great way to tackle my busy schedule. I'm curious how I could use the Eisenhower Matrix to sort through my classes and job responsibilities without feeling so overwhelmed.\ntherapist: Sure, let's break it down together. First, create a table with four quadrants labeled \"Urgent  Important,\" \"Important but not Urgent,\" \"Urgent but not Important,\" and \"Not Urgent  Not Important.\" Then, start categorizing your tasks accordingly. For example, studying for an upcoming exam would be both urgent and important, while organizing your notes might be important but not urgent. This way, you can focus on the most pressing tasks first and allocate time for less urgent ones later.\n\n That makes sense! I can see how this method would help me visualize and prioritize my tasks. However, I'm still a bit unsure about categorizing my job responsibilities since they're all important to me. How can I determine which tasks are more urgent than others?\n\n That's a valid concern. When it comes to your job responsibilities, consider factors like deadlines, customer satisfaction, and the potential consequences of not completing a task on time. For instance, addressing a customer complaint would be more urgent than restocking shelves, as it directly impacts customer satisfaction and could escalate if not handled promptly. Keep in mind that the Eisenhower Matrix is a flexible tool, so you can always adjust your categorization as needed.\nclient: That helps clarify thingsI'll try using deadlines and consequences to sort my job tasks. Still, balancing this with my school workload feels challenging, so I'm wondering how to integrate the matrix for both areas without adding more stress.\ntherapist: Integrating the Eisenhower Matrix for both your school and job tasks can be done in a few simple steps. First, create separate matrices for each area, so you can focus on one aspect at a time. This helps reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. Next, allocate specific time blocks for each quadrant, ensuring that urgent and important tasks receive the most attention. Lastly, remember to schedule breaks and self-care activities to maintain your well-being.

Have you thought about what your career goals are, and how your academic choices might help you get there?\nclient: Yes, I've given some thought to my career goals in the business field. I'm weighing how different academic options might better prepare me for those aspirations, but I'm still feeling unsure about the best fit.\ntherapist: It's great that you've already started thinking about your career goals and how your academic choices might support them. Uncertainty is normal when making big decisions like this, but it can also be helpful to gather more information to inform your decision. Have you looked into the specific courses and opportunities available in each academic option, and how they might help you develop the skills and knowledge you need for your career goals?\nclient: I've started exploring the courses and opportunities for both the general business administration path and the ITM concentration, focusing on how they build relevant skills for my career. Even with this research, I'm still unsure about which option will best align with my long-term goals in business.\ntherapist: It's understandable that even after researching, you still feel uncertain about the best choice for your long-term goals. Making a decision can be challenging when there are multiple viable options. Have you considered seeking advice from academic advisors, alumni, or professionals in your desired field to gain more insight into potential career paths and the relevance of different academic options?\nclient: I have considered reaching out to academic advisors and possibly alumni for their insights on career paths related to business. However, I'm still feeling uncertain about how their advice might help me clarify the best academic option for my future goals.\ntherapist: It's natural to feel uncertain about how advice from others might impact your decision-making process. Keep in mind that their insights can provide valuable perspectives and help you weigh the pros and cons of each academic option. Ultimately, the decision is yours, and it's essential to listen to your own instincts and aspirations.

I'm concerned that varying opinions could make it harder to decide on the best path for my career aspirations.\ntherapist: I understand your concern about receiving varying opinions from advisors and alumni. It can be helpful to approach these conversations with a clear idea of what you want to learn from them. You might consider preparing specific questions about the curriculum, potential career paths, and industry trends to guide the discussions. This way, you can gather relevant information while maintaining focus on your own aspirations. Remember that you don't need to make a decision immediately take the time you need to process the insights you receive.\nclient: I appreciate the suggestion on preparing questions, as it could help me stay focused amid mixed advice. However, I'm still worried that evaluating career paths in business might feel overwhelming if the insights don't align with my personal goals.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you may encounter differing perspectives during your discussions. Remember that advisors and alumni bring their own unique experiences and backgrounds to the conversation. While their insights can provide valuable context, it's essential to critically evaluate the information you receive and determine how it applies to your specific situation. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or uncertain, take a step back and remind yourself of your personal aspirations. This can help you stay grounded and maintain a clear focus on your own path.\n\n I think that's a good point about critically evaluating the advice I receive.

Can you tell me more about what's been contributing to these feelings of anxiety?\nclient: I've been feeling anxious mainly because my daily routine doesn't feel productive enough, even though I'm managing school and home responsibilities. It's hard not to worry about contributing more when I compare myself to others who are working or more independent.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be more productive and independent, especially when you compare yourself to others. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique path and timeline, and it's okay to focus on your own journey. Have you considered setting small, achievable goals for yourself to help you feel more productive and useful?\nclient: I've thought about setting small goals, like organizing my daily schedule better, but I'm not sure where to start. It could help me feel more productive and less anxious about my contributions at home and school.\ntherapist: It's great that you're open to setting small goals to help you feel more productive. Here's a suggestion try breaking down your daily schedule into smaller, manageable tasks and prioritize them based on importance. This can help you stay organized and focused on one task at a time. What do you think about starting with something like creating a to-do list for tomorrow?\nclient: I think creating a to-do list for tomorrow sounds like a practical first step to make my day feel more structured. It could help me build that sense of productivity and reduce my anxiety about not contributing enough right now.\ntherapist: Great! When creating your to-do list for tomorrow, consider including a mix of tasks related to your responsibilities at home and school. This can help you balance your contributions in both areas. Which tasks do you think you'll prioritize for tomorrow's list?\nclient: I think I'll prioritize tasks like helping with house chores in the morning and reviewing my school assignments in the afternoon to balance my responsibilities. This should help me feel more productive and useful throughout the day.\ntherapist: It's wonderful to see your commitment to setting small, achievable goals. Creating a to-do list with a mix of tasks related to your responsibilities at home and school is an excellent first step. Prioritizing house chores in the morning and reviewing school assignments in the afternoon can help you maintain balance and feel more productive. Remember to take things one step at a time, and be kind to yourself as you work towards your goals. Keep up the great work, and I look forward to our next contact in a month to discuss your progress!\nclient: Thanks for the encouragement I'll focus on my to-do list to balance home and school tasks and start feeling more useful in my daily routine. I look forward to updating you next month on how it's going.","completed":true}

Additionally, opportunities for personal growth and a supportive work environment could help me feel more fulfilled, even if the core tasks don't perfectly align with my passions.\ntherapist: It's great that you're considering various factors contributing to overall career satisfaction. Reflecting on these aspects can help you make a more informed decision about your major. It might be helpful to explore the potential for growth, supportive work environments, and financial stability within computer science or other related fields. Have you researched the job market and career prospects for computer science graduates?\n\n I've done some research, and it seems like computer science graduates have strong job prospects and competitive salaries. The tech industry also appears to have many opportunities for growth and innovation. However, I'm still unsure if it's the right fit for me, considering my interests and skills.\n\n It's good to hear that you're exploring the potential of computer science while acknowledging your interests and skills. As you continue your research, remember that it's okay to take your time in making a decision. It might be helpful to talk with professionals in the field or take an introductory course to get a better sense of the work involved. Would you be open to seeking out such opportunities to gain more insight?\n\n Yes, I think talking to professionals or trying an introductory course could give me a more realistic view of what a career in computer science might look like.\nclient: I'm definitely open to seeking out those opportunities, as they could help me assess if a field like computer science might balance stability with my creative interests. Still, I'm concerned about ensuring any career path doesn't stray too far from what truly motivates me.\ntherapist: That's a valid concern, and it's essential to find a balance between your interests and practical considerations. While exploring computer science, keep reflecting on how it aligns with your motivations and whether it can provide outlets for your creativity. Remember, it's possible to find creative applications within technical fields or pursue your passions outside of work. What do you think could help you stay connected to your creative interests, even if your career path shifts?\nclient: I think engaging in side projects related to animation or cars in my free time could help me maintain that creative spark. Additionally, seeking roles in computer science that involve innovative or design-oriented work might allow me to blend my interests with professional stability.\ntherapist: That's a great approach! Engaging in side projects and finding roles that blend your interests can help you strike a balance between stability and personal fulfillment. As you explore these options, remember to be patient with yourself and keep reflecting on your goals. It might also be helpful to create a list of priorities or deal-breakers in a career to guide your decision-making. How do you plan to start searching for opportunities that combine your interests and provide stability?\nclient: I plan to start by researching computer science job listings and internships that emphasize design or innovation, using platforms like LinkedIn and industry forums. At the same time, I'll look for ways to incorporate my creative passions, such as through freelance animation projects on the side, to ensure my career choices support both stability and personal motivation.\ntherapist: It's great to see that you have a plan in place to explore your interests and potential career paths. Engaging in side projects and searching for opportunities that combine your passions with professional stability are excellent steps to take. Remember to stay patient and flexible throughout this process, and keep reflecting on your priorities.

Would I be canceled\/hated by the people in my college if I did so?\n\nSorry if this isn't the right subreddit for this but I couldn't find a better one. I am going to a school in NY(which I hear is a generally pretty progressive state) and I am from the south.\n\nI am trans\/gay, but I really don't like talking about it that much. I mean I'll talk about relationships and hot people\/characters I like but the subject of my conversations will never really revolve around how prideful I am in my sexuality\/gender. Maybe it's because I'm from the south--and I'm fine with LGBTQ people--I just don't really like the people super active in the LGBTQ community because they make me uncomfortable. Especially the neopronouns\/neogenders crowd. I was made fun of for being trans by other kids and called an \"it\" or asked if I identified as a cat\/dog and how that meant it was okay to sh\/\/t me. And it really dehumanized me--it's a part of my life I don't particularly want shoved in my face every day even if I'm okay speaking up for myself or talking about only occasionally.\n\nI try to be an accepting person. And I do not hate the neopronouns\/neogenders crowd, but being around them makes me uncomfortable so I tend to steer clear. Although I firmly believe you should I what makes you happy I do not think these things are rooted in a medically necessary basis the same way gender dysphoria is. And I worry they would hate me for that belief even if I were to accept\/respect them as people regardless of what I think.\n\nIf I put it out there that I didn't really wanna room with people like that would everyone get mad at me for being exclusionary?

{"id":"127mjfj","timestamp":1680220800000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"I (30M) recently re-entered college as a mature international student in a foreign country. Been here a month.\n\nThe first 2 weeks, I hung around with bunch of international students from Asia. But over time, I felt different from them (18-22 year olds) and started sitting apart from them as I couldn't relate (they only talk about study and stick to themselves, they don't integrate at all with the locals).\n\nThe local students too are mainly 18-21 years old.\n\nRaised in several countries as a kid, I feel too Asian for the (mainly 18-21 y\/old) local students, and too Westernized culturally for the international Asian students. I'm older at 30 than people in both. Other mature students? There's only 1 who talks about study all the time. Due to age and being racially different, I feel I don't fit in anywhere.\n\nI ended up sitting in lectures alone by myself again, and have begun to feel down after a few incidents:\n\n1. Group conversation with a few local students that made eye contact with each other but not with me. I feel they don't want to talk to me, I get quieter more withdrawn; they look less at me and talk more with themselves; I felt hurt and made an excuse to leave.\n2. A classmate who's loud and swears a lot made racist comments about Indian and old white men (she's white herself); I called her out and then she started to argue with me, saying, patronizingly '*you're so pure and innocent*'. I defended myself. We met again today, talked about another topic, she wanted to argue again. My blood pressure rose again.\n3. I asked a younger student a question about exam content and they were sarcastic and rude to me; '*Oh, you didn't read the online announcement...? Because it was posted there... you know*.' with an arrogant expression. Anger I really had to suppress.\n\nWhen I arrived here, I was positive and social. Now; after every failed interaction\/real\/perceived rejection, and trying to socialize whilst focusing on the intensity of the course (studying 8 hours a day including Saturdays) I feel more weary and the people who were either rude or ignored me I feel anger towards and do not want to talk with anymore. These people are on a course with me for the next five years.\n\nI feel on the outside looking in. I'm way older at 30 here and, as I sit on the outside of these local and international student groups in class, who talk amongst themselves, I go back home to my room alone. I play guitar alone. I feel intense sadness and frustration, like, just for one day I wish I could disappear. I've joined a few Meetup groups but they start next week.\n\nI feel like I want to drop out of this course so I don't have to deal with this anymore.

Can you tell me more about what it's like for you on a day-to-day basis?\nclient: On a typical day, I go to classes feeling disconnected from my peers due to the age gap and cultural differences, which makes me sit alone and avoid interactions. This isolation leaves me feeling increasingly sad and unmotivated, affecting my daily routine and studies.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of loneliness and disconnection, which is taking a toll on your mental health and academic life. It's natural to feel this way when you're in an environment where you feel different from those around you. Have you tried exploring any clubs, organizations, or activities that might help you connect with people who share your interests?\nclient: I've joined a few Meetup groups that align with my interests, and they start next week, which I'm hoping will help. However, on campus, I haven't delved into clubs yet due to feeling out of place with my peers.\ntherapist: It's great that you've taken the initiative to join Meetup groups that align with your interests, and I hope they provide a sense of connection and belonging. It's also understandable that you might feel hesitant about joining campus clubs due to the age and cultural differences. However, it's worth noting that many clubs often have a diverse range of members, and you might find individuals who share similar interests or experiences. Have you considered reaching out to any clubs or organizations that pique your interest, even if it's just to learn more about their activities and members?\nclient: I've considered reaching out to campus clubs that interest me, like those related to music or culture, but I haven't followed through yet due to my ongoing feelings of not fitting in with the younger crowd. This hesitation stems from past experiences that make me wary of potential rejections.\ntherapist: It's completely understandable to feel hesitant about putting yourself out there, especially after experiencing rejection in the past. However, it's important to remember that each new situation is an opportunity to connect with others and build a sense of belonging. Is there a specific club or organization that particularly interests you, and if so, would you be open to exploring it further by attending a meeting or event?\nclient: Yes, the music club on campus particularly interests me because it aligns with my hobby of playing guitar. I'm somewhat open to attending a meeting, but my past experiences make me cautious about potential rejections from the younger members.\ntherapist: It's great that you've identified the music club as a potential avenue for connecting with others. While it's natural to feel cautious, attending a meeting could be a valuable opportunity to meet like-minded individuals who share your passion for music. To make it more comfortable, would you consider bringing a friend or reaching out to the club president beforehand to express your interest and ask any questions you might have?\nclient: I might consider reaching out to the club president first to ease my concerns, as it feels like a lower-pressure way to gauge the group. However, bringing a friend isn't feasible right now since I don't have close connections here yet.\ntherapist: It's great to see your willingness to take steps towards connecting with others. Remember that building new relationships takes time and effort, so be patient and kind to yourself throughout the process. Reaching out to the club president is an excellent first step, and it could help you feel more at ease before attending a meeting. Keep in mind that your shared interest in music can serve as a foundation for connecting with other club members, regardless of age differences. I encourage you to give it a try and see how it goes. Let's plan to follow up in a month to discuss your progress and any new challenges or successes you've experienced.\nclient: I'll take your advice and reach out to the club president to start, though I'm still cautious about age differences making it hard to connect. Thanks for the support I'll check back in a month as planned.","completed":true}

{"id":"10663sm","timestamp":1673136000000,"category":"school_life","concern":"Hi! First post on this sub, and it’s such a crazy story.\n\nThis last semester (1st year, out of state) I was rooming with one of my good friends, at a small private university. \n\nWe walk into our dorm together and bam, a single queen sized bed in a room meant for two people? Previous resident lived alone and somehow the original beds got taken away, and there was a very nice queen sized bed (that didn’t match). Also we noticed the desk is odd, is less than foot wide and spans the entire length of one wall. It was nonfunctional it was so skinny.\n\nSo after we see our room we go to find our RA, and we ask her what in the world was up with our room. She said our two twin beds got moved to another room that caught on fire so they are going to get more. Lovely. Also, they couldn’t move the horrible desk because it would damage the floor since it was bolted to the floor??????\n\nWell, since we are so far out of state we can’t exactly go home. We ended up having the share the bed (thank goodness it was a good friend of mine). That lasted for a whole TWO WEEKS. Everyday we talked to someone about it, absolutely nothing. Until two weeks later they say they finally have two twins.\n\nAlso, we ended up being allowed to bring in a desk from the library that they weren’t using, because ours couldn’t hold a single laptop. It was bad.\n\nBy the end of the whole ordeal when our room was completely usable, (and we didn’t have to share a bed) we went to talk to these people (don’t know their positions). My roommate\/friend and I basically pitched a fit about how there should have been two beds in that room, and it probably violated a code somewhere. We ended up not having to pay full room and board for the issues we had.\n\nIt was a mess, we pulled through and won’t be staying on campus again.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hi there!

It can be very helpful in calming the mind and reducing anxiety.\n\n Yes, I've tried deep breathing exercises before and found them to be somewhat helpful. I'm interested in learning more techniques to add to my toolbox.\n\n Absolutely, having a variety of techniques can be beneficial in managing anxiety. Another helpful strategy is progressive muscle relaxation. This involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body, which can help release physical tension and promote relaxation. Would you like to give it a try?\n\n I haven't tried progressive muscle relaxation before, but it sounds promising. I'm willing to give it a shot, especially if it can help alleviate some of the tension I've been experiencing.\nclient: I'm ready to try progressive muscle relaxation right now, as I'm hoping it will help ease the general tension that's been building from my ongoing worries. Let me know how to get started with the exercises.\ntherapist: Great! Let's begin with a simple progressive muscle relaxation exercise. Please find a comfortable seated position, with your back straight and your feet flat on the ground. Take a few deep breaths to settle into the exercise. We'll start by focusing on the muscles in your face. Begin by raising your eyebrows as high as you can, hold for a few seconds, and then release.\n\n Okay, I've raised my eyebrows and released the tension. I'm feeling a bit more relaxed in my forehead already.\n\n Wonderful! Now let's move on to your jaw. Clench your teeth together tightly, hold for a moment, and then release. Remember to keep breathing steadily throughout the exercise.\n\n I've clenched and released my jaw. I can feel some of the tension leaving my face. What's the next muscle group we'll focus on?\nclient: I've tensed and released my shoulders as per your guidance, and it's starting to ease some of the built-up tension that's been weighing on me. What's the next muscle group we'll work on?\ntherapist: Great to hear that you're feeling some relief in your shoulders. Let's continue by focusing on your arms and hands. Start by making a tight fist with each hand, hold for a few seconds, and then release.\n\n I've made fists with both hands and released them. I'm noticing that my arms feel a bit lighter now.\n\n That's good progress! Next, stretch your arms out in front of you, and then pull them back towards your body, tensing the muscles as you do so. Hold for a moment, and then release.\n\n I've completed the arm stretching exercise, and it's helping me become more aware of the tension I've been holding onto. What's the next step?\n\n We'll now move on to your legs. While seated, extend your legs straight out in front of you and point your toes. Hold this position for a few seconds, then release.\n\n I've extended my legs and pointed my toes as instructed. I can feel the muscles in my legs starting to relax.\n\n Well done! Now, let's focus on your feet. Curl your toes tightly, hold for a moment, and then release. Remember to continue breathing steadily throughout the exercise.\nclient: I've curled my toes tightly and then released them, feeling a slight release of tension in my feet that's helping with the overall anxiety I've been carrying. What's the next muscle group we'll focus on?\ntherapist: We've covered most of the major muscle groups, so let's move on to a full-body stretch to further release any remaining tension. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart, and reach your arms up above your head, stretching your entire body. Hold for a few seconds, and then slowly lower your arms back down.\n\n I've completed the full-body stretch, and it's helped me become more aware of my body as a whole and the anxiety that I've been holding onto.\n\n It's great to hear that you're becoming more in tune with your body. As we wrap up the progressive muscle relaxation exercise, I want you to take a few deep breaths and perform a mental body scan. Notice any remaining areas of tension and try to consciously release them.\n\n I've taken some deep breaths and scanned my body, releasing any remaining tension that I could find. Overall, I'm feeling a bit more relaxed and in control of my emotions than when we started.\n\n That's wonderful progress! Remember, you can practice this technique whenever you feel anxiety starting to build up, as it can help you manage your emotions and regain a sense of control.\n\n Thank you for guiding me through this exercise.\nclient: I appreciate this technique for helping me manage my anxiety more effectively. What's the next step in our sessions?\ntherapist: Now that we've found a technique that helps you manage your anxiety, I suggest we continue practicing it in our future sessions. Consistency is key in building your ability to cope with anxious feelings. We can also explore other relaxation techniques or mindfulness exercises that might further support your emotional well-being.\n\n As we move forward, it's important to remember that addressing unresolved issues from your past may still be beneficial in reducing anxiety. However, we'll only discuss those experiences when you feel comfortable and ready to do so. Our primary focus will remain on equipping you with the tools you need to manage your emotions effectively.\n\n How does that sound to you?\nclient: That sounds like a good plan I'm on board with continuing the techniques to help manage my ongoing anxiety. I appreciate focusing on building coping tools at my own pace, as it gives me more control over my emotions.\ntherapist: Great! Let's continue practicing these techniques in our future sessions and monitor your progress. It's essential to be patient with yourself and remember that managing anxiety is a process. With consistent practice, you'll likely notice improvements in your ability to cope with anxious feelings.\n\n As we work together, I'll also provide you with additional resources, such as mindfulness exercises or journaling prompts, which can complement the relaxation techniques we've been practicing. These tools can offer further support in managing your emotions and promoting overall well-being.\n\n Remember, our goal is to empower you with a variety of strategies that you can use to navigate challenging emotions effectively. Feel free to share your thoughts and experiences during our sessions, as your feedback will help us tailor the techniques to best suit your needs.\nclient: I'm looking forward to trying those additional resources to help with my anxiety management. I'd be happy to share more about my experiences so we can adjust the techniques accordingly.\ntherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're open to incorporating additional resources and sharing your experiences. This will help us create a personalized approach to managing your anxiety. As we move forward, remember that progress takes time, and it's essential to be kind to yourself throughout the process.\n\n For now, continue practicing the relaxation techniques we've discussed, and feel free to explore the additional resources I'll provide. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Remember, you can reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns before then.\n\n Take care, and I'll see you at our next appointment.\nclient: Thanks for the resources I'll keep practicing the techniques and give them a try to help manage my anxiety better. See you at the next session.","completed":true}

It's great that you're reaching out and wanting to talk about the challenges you're facing at school.

It's hard to connect with people or keep up with my studies when everything feels so overwhelming.\ntherapist: That sounds really tough. Feeling isolated and unmotivated can definitely make school a challenging environment. It's understandable that it's hard to connect with others and stay on top of your studies when you're feeling overwhelmed. Have you thought about reaching out to a teacher, counselor, or even a classmate for support? Sometimes just talking about what you're going through can help you feel less alone and more motivated.\nclient: I've thought about reaching out for support, and I have already spoken with a counselor. Even so, it's been challenging to feel less isolated and regain my motivation.\ntherapist: It sounds like you've taken some steps to address your concerns, but things are still difficult. It can take time and patience to see improvements in our mental health and well-being. Have you considered exploring different coping strategies or activities that might help you feel more connected and motivated, such as joining a club or participating in a hobby that you enjoy?\nclient: I've thought about joining a club or pursuing a hobby to feel more connected, but it's been difficult to take that step due to my ongoing sense of isolation. Even considering these options hasn't sparked much motivation yet.\ntherapist: It's understandable that taking that first step can be challenging when feeling isolated. However, remember that small actions can lead to significant changes over time. Have you considered breaking down the process into smaller, more manageable steps? Perhaps start by researching clubs or activities that align with your interests, or reaching out to a friend or classmate to join you in exploring a new hobby. Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace.\nclient: I've considered breaking things down into smaller steps, but it's been tough to start due to my ongoing lack of energy. I'm not sure if researching clubs or reaching out to others will help right now, given how disconnected I feel.\ntherapist: It seems like your lack of energy is making it difficult to take even small steps towards connecting with others or finding activities you enjoy. Sometimes, addressing one aspect of our mental health can positively impact other areas. Have you considered discussing strategies to improve your energy levels with your counselor or exploring self-care practices that might help increase your motivation?\nclient: I've considered discussing strategies to improve my energy levels with my counselor, but I haven't acted on it yet due to my ongoing struggles. Exploring self-care practices has crossed my mind, though it's been hard to muster the motivation to begin.\ntherapist: I can see how challenging it must be to find motivation when you're feeling this way. However, remember that self-care practices can be as simple as taking a short walk, practicing deep breathing, or engaging in a brief meditation session. These small acts of self-care can have a significant impact on your energy levels and motivation. Would you be willing to try one small self-care activity today and observe how it affects your mood and energy?\nclient: I've been hesitant to try new activities due to my low energy, but I'll attempt a short walk today as you suggested. I'll observe how it impacts my mood, though I'm not sure if it will make a big difference right now.\ntherapist: It's great to hear that you're open to trying a short walk today. Remember, the goal isn't to see a drastic change immediately but to observe any subtle shifts in your mood or energy levels. Even a small improvement can be a positive sign that you're moving in the right direction. After your walk, would you be willing to share your observations with me or your counselor so that we can continue to support you in finding effective self-care practices?\nclient: I appreciate the support and am willing to share my observations after the walk. However, I'm still finding it tough to stay motivated, so I'll see how this goes before discussing it further with you or my counselor.\ntherapist: It's great to see your willingness to try a small self-care activity and share your observations.

I'd like to compare its career support features with those at Michigan Tech to see which might better align with my goals.\ntherapist: It appears that the University of Michigan Flint offers a range of career support features to help students with their career development. These include career exploration and planning, internship and job searching, interview preparation, networking opportunities, and access to career fairs.

First, acknowledge your current struggle by saying, \"This is a moment of suffering.\" Second, remind yourself that you're not alone by saying, \"Suffering is a part of life.\" Lastly, offer yourself kindness by placing your hands over your heart and saying, \"May I be kind to myself in this moment.\" Would you like to give this technique a try?\nclient: Yes, I'd like to try the Self-Compassion Break technique. I'm hoping it might help me build some inner strength as I face what's next.\ntherapist: It's great to see your willingness to try the Self-Compassion Break technique. Practicing this exercise regularly can help you develop a more supportive inner dialogue and enhance your resilience. Remember to be patient with yourself as you learn this new skill. Over time, you may notice a positive shift in how you relate to yourself and your challenges. Keep in mind that progress is not always linear, and setbacks are a natural part of growth.\n\nLet's plan to follow up in two weeks to discuss your experiences with the Self-Compassion Break and any other strategies you've tried to build connections. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need additional support. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\nclient: I'll give the Self-Compassion Break a try to help ease my ongoing loneliness and worries about the future. Thanks, and I'll touch base in two weeks.","completed":true}

Even with that, the daily grind still wears on me, and I'm hoping for some real shifts to reignite my motivation.\ntherapist: It's clear that you're committed to improving your college experience, and taking steps like preparing for the advisor meeting will help you work towards that goal. Remember that progress may not happen all at once, but each effort you make brings you closer to a more fulfilling academic journey.

As for connecting with other students, consider joining study groups, attending student events, or reaching out to classmates to form a support network. Which of these steps do you feel most comfortable taking first?\nclient: I feel most comfortable approaching my advisor first, as it could provide direct guidance on managing my coursework without overwhelming me. Once I have that support in place, I'll be more ready to connect with other students for additional encouragement.\ntherapist: It's great that you're prioritizing your mental well-being and taking steps to manage your academic workload more effectively. Reaching out to your advisor first seems like a wise choice, as they can provide valuable guidance and support tailored to your specific situation. Remember to be open and honest during your conversation, and don't hesitate to ask for the help you need.

{"id":"121bbga","timestamp":1679702400000,"category":"emotional","concern":"By “safe route” I mean sticking to online classes or going to community college. I’m 22 and I’ve been doing online classes since 2020. Everything was fine at first. I did zoom meetings my first year and then started doing classes asynchronously. I’ll be done with my associates this year, thankfully. Took me a bit longer than usual since I switched schools but other than that it’s not too bad. I don’t regret my choice but recently I’ve been feeling a lot of FOMO. I don’t do much outside of school and work and I feel like if I would’ve stayed in a dorm then my social life would’ve been better. I try to hang out with the few friends I have but that gets hard. I also traveled a few times last year which was fun but now I just feel like I could be doing so much more with my time and it sucks that I’m not. I just wish I had more people to hang with. I didn’t see the point in staying in a dorm when I first started school since it was online and then I didn’t care about dorming for my second year. The dorms at the school I was going to were pretty crappy, and then on top of that, my school was super far from me and since I didn’t have a car there was just no way for me to get there which is why I stayed online. \n\nI didn’t feel like this before, I just think FOMO is starting to get to me now because my older sister thinks I’m “wasting my youth” and then I see my old school friends on social media having so much fun at college and it just makes me feel left out. I know we can’t always control our situations and sometimes we just have to deal with it, it just sucks.

The problem is, to be able to take this course, you need to take Course A and Course B first. Course A and Course B are independent of each other (so you can take one before the other or at the same time, but both are prerequisites for Course C. \n\nI'm taking Course B this semester, but I haven't taken Course A nor was I planning to, since I thought I would be fine without this prerequisite. When I asked for approval for Course C, they denied due to me not taking Course A. I was upset at first but I wasn't done just yet. One of my friends told me that Course A had a midterm coming up soon, so I had the idea to take the midterm without being enrolled in Course A to prove that I can handle it. \n\nI asked the professor of Course A for permission and he agreed. Unfortunately, the midterm of Course A overlapped with a midterm in Course B, so the professor moved me to the conflict exam. At our university, people taking conflict exams for a class take it at a larger \"conflict session\", where people from various classes making up exams take it in the same classroom, which also saves effort in proctoring. Due to the fact that people from various classes are taking the exam in a conflict session, the professor has to prepare a folder with a student's name, class, id, and test on it. \n\nThere was one person actually enrolled in Course A at the conflict session. When the proctor passed out folders that was when we found out that the professor had actually written my name and id on the folder but not the other student's name. The student said that he did email the professor over a month ago telling him that he couldn't make all three normal midterms so he had to take the conflict for all of them. Since the proctor only had one copy of the exam, and my name was the one listed in the folder he gave me the copy of the exam. I decided I was taking the exam (even though ditching the exam would have not harmed me since I wasn't even enrolled in the course) and took the one copy they had, so the other student had no choice to leave. I'm not sure if the professor will give him another date or just give him a 0. \n\nI feel rather guilty and I think I should've let him take the exam instead of me. But again it was technically my name that was listed so it should've been my exam, but I feel rather uneasy since I didn't need the exam. \n\nFor those of you wondering how the exam went for me, it actually went pretty well.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hi there!

Remember, the goal is to make a well-informed decision that aligns with your values and aspirations, but it's also essential to maintain forward momentum and avoid becoming overwhelmed by the process.\nclient: I think documenting my thoughts could help me stay organized in evaluating my options. I'll consider setting a deadline to keep moving forward without overanalyzing the choices.\ntherapist: That's a great plan! Once you have your deadline set, you might find it helpful to break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This can make the task feel less daunting and help you maintain a sense of accomplishment as you progress. As you complete each step, remember to acknowledge your efforts and celebrate the small victories along the way. This will not only keep you motivated but also serve as a reminder of the progress you're making toward your ultimate goal of making a well-informed decision.\nclient: I agree that breaking down the process into smaller steps could make it easier to manage my decision-making without feeling overwhelmed. I'll focus on acknowledging my progress as I go, to stay motivated toward choosing the option that best aligns with my long-term goals.\ntherapist: As we wrap up our conversation, it's clear that you've identified key strategies to help you navigate your decision-making process. By utilizing a weighted scoring approach, documenting your thoughts, setting a deadline, and breaking down the process into manageable steps, you'll be better equipped to make a well-informed choice that aligns with your values and aspirations. Remember to take your time, be patient with yourself, and celebrate your progress along the way. I encourage you to continue implementing these strategies and reflecting on your decision-making journey. If you find it helpful, we can schedule a follow-up conversation in a few weeks to discuss your progress and any additional support you may need.\nclient: I'll definitely implement these strategies to help me evaluate my options more effectively, and I appreciate the offer for a follow-up if I need more guidance.","completed":true}

{"id":"1fwtlpk","timestamp":1728086400000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"I understand that it can take some time getting used to someone with different habits than you, but it’s not getting any better and I don’t know what to do. \n\nI didn’t know my roommate beforehand. My university used RoomSync, which is kind of like a dating app where you swipe through profiles with basic roommate preferences. She requested to be my roommate before even talking, which I thought was a little weird, so I started a conversation. We barely texted over the summer, nothing more than living preferences, who brings what, and basic interests. This probably should have been an indicator that we wouldn’t be super close. \n\nWhen we got here, she asked if it was ok if she FaceTimed her friends. Sure, I don’t care. I didn’t realize she meant every second that she wasn’t sleeping or in the bathroom (which is in our dorm - so happy there’s no communal bathroom). I made it clear before we agreed to be roommates that I need silence when I’m studying. I can’t focus with a lot of talking or noise in the background. She said the same thing. Yet, now she’s always talking while she’s studying. I can’t concentrate, so I have to go out to the lounge area by the elevators to study every night. She does leave when she notices I’m about to go to bed (I have to 8 AM’s, twice a week), which is nice, but I feel like if she studies better with noise, she should go study outside of the room. I’ve never directly asked her to leave, just subtle reminders that I need it to be quiet when studying. I don’t want to start conflict, and this is her room too, but it’s also my room, and I don’t think I can do this for a whole year. I also wonder why she told me she studied in silence too, when she doesn’t. Maybe this is really pushing it too far, but I honestly wonder if she didn’t just say that so she could have a quiet roommate who wasn’t always talking, as to not interfere with her always talking on the phone. \n\nI was really hoping I’d get a roommate that I could be friends with since I’m not great at making friends. I’m really shy, but I’m the type of person that if you start the conversation, I’m great at talking. I’m just too scared\/awkward to go up to someone and start talking first. My roommate made it clear the day we got here that she didn’t want to talk or be friends. We never talk, other than occasionally asking when the other person is getting up\/going to bed, or when she’s coming back since she usually goes home for the weekend. \n\nOn top of the studying issues, she always turns the lights on when she gets up before me (3 times a week), which wakes me up. I understand that she needs light to see and get ready, but she even leaves them on when she showers. Why do you need the kitchen and vanity lights on when you’re in the bathroom for half an hour? (Note: the vanity lights is for the bathroom sink, which is outside of the bathroom that has the toilet and shower.) This isn’t as big of an issue, I’ve semi-gotten used to it. Now I just go to bed with the blanket over my face, it’s just kind of annoying. \n\nPlus, now she’s stopped doing her chores. We agreed that I’d vacuum, take the trash out (main big one + little bathroom one), and clean the shower every week, while she would clean the toilet, both sinks, and Swiffer every other week. The sinks are always dirty (you know the soap residue that builds up on the faucet), and she keeps wiping the mirror down, but leaves awful streaks that you can barely see your reflection, so I have to rewipe it. I don’t know about the toilet, maybe she does it when I’m not there, and maybe she Swiffers, but I never see a Swiffer pad in the trash, so I don’t think so? This also isn’t a huge deal, it only takes me a couple of minutes to watch the sinks and mirror, but it’s just kind of annoying because it is her room too. \n\nThe main problem is the constant FaceTiming, but these other little things just build onto it. I’m really starting to dislike her, which I don’t want to, but she’s getting on my nerves. I know things could be worse, I’ve heard some roommate horror stories. One friend I’ve made that’s a junior told me how unlucky one of her friends was as a freshman, which my case isn’t nearly as bad. I know part of the problem is because I haven’t said anything, I just don’t want to start something knowing that I probably can’t get a different room. I really want a different roommate next semester, but if I say something to the RA and the change can’t happen, then it’ll just be awkward if she finds out. Should I say something? How should I say it? I don’t know what to do. ","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hey there! How are you doing today?

I'm so stressed out that I won't be able to remember all this information since my brain isn't.. the best? I have an IEP (individualized education program) where it's meant for students who just need the extra help and time when it comes to their assignments & tests. \n\nAfter my first day of biology and everyone left, I just started having a panic attack because of all the information about the class that was thrown at me. My professor noticed & asked if I was okay. I couldn't breathe and he told me to \"let it all out\". Once I was able to catch my breath, I told him how my brain functions differently and it just works slower compared to others. He kept asking me how he can help me, and told me to go to the counselor's office to get accommodations for my IEP so when I take the lab and lecture exams, I'll get extra time. I'm thankful he's understanding and he stopped me from feeling embarrassed.\n\nI've always had an IEP on my student file, but I've never once used the accommodations because I want to learn without the extra help, but I think this time I finally need to use it because I am not confident in biology at all.\n\nI just need to pass with a C minimum so it transfers overs to the University. I always study my hardest where I don't overload my brain with information, but Biology is a crazy amount of memorizing. I chose the seat closest to my professor's desk and I'm going to ask him a lot of questions. I really want to pass this class with a C, I don't think it's possible for me to get anything higher than that because my brain sucks. I wish I had a normal brain.\n\nI'm extremely worried, my emotional health has gotten so much worse ever since my first day of biology class on Friday. I hope my professor sees that I'm really trying and will go a little bit easier\/lenient on me, and that is never something I EVER expect because life isn't always easy in the real world.

{"id":"1c7pyey","timestamp":1713484800000,"category":"school_life","concern":"I'm 21, I've been studying computer science and going to graduate end of this year. But I'm not your average comp sci student, i got into it due to my passion of creating products, but uni hasn't been liked this, focusing on theoretical coding\/math which I'm extremely bad at (Ive always been like this). I've barely passed most of my courses through memorization, asking many questions, and spending lots of time through brute force. I haven't truely learnt or understood much. I don't know, I've just always been like this since school, I can put lots of time into things I'm passionate about, but not efficiently or with good coding standards.\n\nAs such, I'm not confident in my abilities so I'm not looking forward to getting my first job (I've been on the doll). I will have like 30k in HECs, and 25k in the bank by graduation, which I'm at a crossroads of putting into HISA or ETFs but that isn't the point of this post.\n\nI also have had been amazed by stuff like chatgpt, I've kept up with all of the research and developments. It's been a light in the tunnel, but also a dark one, for someone like me who isn't smart. Dark in the sense that if I take a gap year, I'm almost sure ill come back to systems which are nearing the point of making me obsolete in the work force. It might not be there yet but its semantics at that point, it'll happen in the next year or two if it isn't.\n\nHowever, it is also amazing because it can then help me to create all the ideas I have, and I could be some baby enterpreneur. I would LOVE if it worked out like this and i could finance it.\n\nAnd I havent really gotten to travel. I've been told if I travel after graduating it'll be harder for me to find a job afterwards. This is concerning because I'm already not confident in finding a job. And my friends and family will keep asking me what I'm doing and I just hate that, I just want to be left alone. And I genuinely think I'll only get to work a couple of years before AI makes me pointless in the workforce. It sounds nice for me to travel for X months and come back to a different reality where i can see where my skills may be needed elsewhere. As for my travelling, I'm not sure where I'd go yet, but I'd love to backpack solo and travel on the cheapest of shoestrings. By working while I'm overseas (even though i've never worked before) and couch surfing, or pet sitting, or sleeping in a hamac, id hopefully limit costs so that I won't be taking $ out of the bank. also not sure how long i could go for but the more the merrier I say? I'll practice it in australia before before going overseas.\n\nAnd most importantly, expectations of my future and my wants\/needs:\n\nI do not care to have a family, I do not care for a house, I'd much rather a hotel next to public transit in a walkable city. I don't have a car and I don't plan on getting one (I have my license but I just hate driving so I don't). I really hate the rat race of society which is likely why ive not worked a day in my life or done too well at uni. How I've been treated while on the doll has reaffirmed this, and mental health has declined just from this idea of how people treat you differently. It's actually made me want to work **less** because I'm really stubborn and if someone annoys or patronizes me I **hate** taking their advice. I would rather sacrifice my livelihood by living as cheaply as possible while still feeling secure by having access to necessities ie food\/power\/sleep then to constantly focus on money. For what? Just so I can afford to eat out, shop and buy junk or go on some extravagent travel? I'd rather cook something myself (even if I dont have many of the skills atm), only buy necessities that I really really need, or go on cheap travels and experience the country in a less touristy manner. As such, I do not really care if i get 200k, 100k or 50k as my annual income, I already don't spend money as is (Thats how ive got 20k in the bank without working. I do live with my parents though.). All I really want and value is time, so I can focus on other parts of my life.\n\nAlso, I have like 0 life skills but im willing to learn if i'm not patronized constantly, which is the main reason I haven't up until now. That's a big reason why I want to travel and work overseas or live with others.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hey there, how's it going today?
