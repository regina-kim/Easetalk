  "concern": "I’m a recently turned 20F and I’ve been sheltered all my life. I don’t have the most reliable friends/ family members and I don’t have a car. Any form of independence I’ve tried to gain has been shot down immediately by fear tactics or threats. I understand that I’m a legal adult but I’m having a hard time understanding how to move out especially with the cost of everything. I’m in university and although I technically get a break I get very paranoid going back home.\n\nMy household isn’t physically abusive anymore it’s just mentally abusive now. I won’t go into the details but all I’ll say is jealousy leads to very dangerous situations. Although I’m not in danger at the moment I’m starting to feel uncomfortable being at home.\n\nAt first I was going to wait til graduation but this summer was so bad, I need to make preparations now.",
