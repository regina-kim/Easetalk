  "concern": "Hey all\n\nI (19) am currently in my spring semester of my first year of college. I currently am attending an art school and studying for an elementary art education degree. But idk..\n\nI want to maybe switch to marketing/digital marketing. The salary is higher than that of a teacher, which is nice. I also just am realizing I don’t wanna be in art school anymore\n\nI love art and will continue to work freelance, but I don’t feel as though going to school for it is necessary\n\nAnother big thing is that I want to move out. My living situation is awful… But with being a student full time, I can barely get in 15hr of work a week. I live in Massachusetts and the rent is crazy high here \n\nI’m wondering if perhaps transferring to an online school and then working more frequently would make sense? \n\nHow does one find a good, reputable online college? They aren’t showing up on college board",
