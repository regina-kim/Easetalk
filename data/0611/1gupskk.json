  "concern": "Yes, I am one of those people who are still thinking about college applications as a college student. No, I cannot stop it no matter how much I try. I feel that my mindset is ruining my performance, both socially and academically at my current school. It feels like my high school was a waste of time, so why should I try again just to get rejected from whatever comes next. Regardless, idk what comes next, college was kinda my main goal my whole life that it just feels empty, depressing, and I just feel out of place at my current school which I don't feel that great about. \n\nIt just feels awful to see so many of my friends moving on towards their goals at top schools while im still stuck here. We are no longer on the same plane that we were a year ago, they have moved so far ahead and I can never catch up with them anymore. I get that I can be successful without a specific school, or get a masters there (which I personally think is a waste of time and money anyways), but I really really wanted to go for undergrad and belong to their community. I see so many people wearing their merch and attending school events and it genuinely feels so awful idk what to do now, I lost my chance forever, the school doesn't even accept transfers for students at four year institutes.
