  "concern": "I have just recently started my final semester of university. I had a lot of difficult coursework my first two years in college, but after that, I haven't been assigned much of anything to do in my last couple of semesters. My last semester all of my professors were gone for weeks on end and even one where I had two classes with had a health emergency and i had my two biggest final exams canceled. I don't want to sound like I am bragging because I am not, I feel like the university is just wasting my time and money a little bit at this point. This semester, my last, I only have one required class to take and the four random classes I am taking to fill out my needed credit hours even. My 400 level classes I have been taking have only like 2-8 students total so it feels like the professor is just shooting the shit with us rather than doing much of value. I feel lucky to not be busy with work but I just want to be done already so I can start making some real money. Is there anyone here in a similar position?",
