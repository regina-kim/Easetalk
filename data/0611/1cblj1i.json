  "concern": "For context: I was that girl who was 16 and pregnant, I know I’m going to get hate for that but I don’t care nothing I can do about it now. I recently had another baby last year which again was a total accident, I know I’m going to get hate for that too BUT IDC. \n\nTHE POINT OF THIS IS I really want to go to college. I own my home with my bf so obviously I have bills to pay. Daycare is 1K a month, my car alone with insurance is another 1K a month, 2k for the house PLUS utilities, not to mention groceries and other basic life expenses. \n\nI tried to continue my full time position and go to college online, but I was exhausted. By the time I get off work at 6pm and make dinner and get the kids ready for bed, then I’m up all night studying with NO SLEEP and a NEWBORN BABY and a FULL TIME JOB…. I dropped out. I just couldn’t do it. \n\nMy bf can’t pay all the bills by himself, there’s just no way we could live like that… I’m coming to Reddit to ask for advice. I desperately need some direction. I want to take an accelerated course for my BSN and then work for a few years and go back to become a nurse practitioner later. I can get my BSN in TWO years. Only two freakin years. \n\nWhat do I do?? Have any of y’all been in a similar situation??? How do you manage going to school with kids?????? Do I sell my house and try to find some cheap ass apartment by the school or maybe ON the school??? Are there schools that will allow children if I were to get my own dorm??? Am I just fucked? \n\nSomeone please give me some insight.",
