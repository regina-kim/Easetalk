  "concern": "I was speaking to a class friend the other day and at some point she brought up that she hates when individual students \"hog\" the study rooms when it should only be groups in there. At my campus, the policy is that individuals are allowed to use them, but groups of 2 or more are also allowed to (politely) kick them out if they need the space. These rules are posted pretty clearly in front of each room, so I didn't really understand her complaint... they're not hogging it, you could just ask them for the room.\n\nI often do this as an individual (didn't tell her that though), but I recognize a lot of people are shy, have social anxiety, or they feel bad about kicking someone out. So one hand I feel bad since I might be the reason some people can't get a room, but on the other hand I don't feel like that's necessarily my fault. Thoughts?",
