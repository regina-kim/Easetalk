You could probably have a number of degrees before graduating high school just for fun. Any thoughts on that? Anybody's kid do it?\n\n*this was more of just a fun thought experiment because there are easy free college credits you can get online. Obv unless you're a genius, you're not doing a an actual 4 yr university. Though some things like programming could be used and supplement regular classes and just be part of a programming hobby",
