  "concern": "I am asking because Norovirus and other stomach bugs are going around campus. Ideally, I would just prevent it, but sometimes it’s inevitable. Stomach bugs cause some really nasty symptoms, and if there’s any kind of accident, it is going to be difficult to clean in a dorm.\n\nMy dorms have one toilet and one shower for the ENTIRE HALL. Technically, we have 2 of each, but the locks have been removed. They have also taken away every single paper towel machine on campus, so there is no easy access to paper towels.\n\nI know my question is gross, but how do you deal with a stomach bug in this situation? What if you throw up but miss the toilet? What if the bathroom is occupied but you NEED to go? At home, it would be easy to clean up, disinfect, and dispose of soiled towels or wipes. Not here. Sometimes these bugs have people having diarrhea and throwing up at the same time, so a huge mess is guaranteed in that situation. That’s a big mess that there is no way to clean up, not to mention, really embarrassing.\n\nI can’t find anything to answer my question online. I’m sorry, I know this is gross. Is there anything you guys would recommend having around, or advice on how you managed having a bad stomach bug in dorms? Please remember I only have iuone toilet and no paper towels (they are not for sale anywhere on campus and I ran out, I only have tissues and Lysol wipes). I want to be prepared before this is an issue.",
