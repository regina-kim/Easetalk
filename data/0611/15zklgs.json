  "concern": "I took a gap year after high school, moved out of state, then went to community college for my first two years then transferred to a big university and last year I was just depressed and not focused on socializing. I have a couple acquaintances at college but no friends. It’s my last year but I don’t wanna remember college as just online school and then being lonely on a big campus. Any advice for finding friends as an upperclassman? It feels like everyone already has their friend groups and I don’t know how to go about socializing. \n\nAlso if you have any advice on how to get over the general social anxiety I feel on campus and in classes it would be much appreciated. I feel like an outsider, like I’m too old and like I don’t belong. I also know I’m just being a baby but that doesn’t get rid of the feeling\n\nThanks sm!!",
