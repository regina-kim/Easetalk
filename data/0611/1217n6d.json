  "concern": "At my university, there is course (let's call it Course C) I really want to take. The problem is, to be able to take this course, you need to take Course A and Course B first. Course A and Course B are independent of each other (so you can take one before the other or at the same time, but both are prerequisites for Course C. \n\nI'm taking Course B this semester, but I haven't taken Course A nor was I planning to, since I thought I would be fine without this prerequisite. When I asked for approval for Course C, they denied due to me not taking Course A. I was upset at first but I wasn't done just yet. One of my friends told me that Course A had a midterm coming up soon, so I had the idea to take the midterm without being enrolled in Course A to prove that I can handle it. \n\nI asked the professor of Course A for permission and he agreed. Unfortunately, the midterm of Course A overlapped with a midterm in Course B, so the professor moved me to the conflict exam. At our university, people taking conflict exams for a class take it at a larger \"conflict session\", where people from various classes making up exams take it in the same classroom, which also saves effort in proctoring. Due to the fact that people from various classes are taking the exam in a conflict session, the professor has to prepare a folder with a student's name, class, id, and test on it. \n\nThere was one person actually enrolled in Course A at the conflict session. When the proctor passed out folders that was when we found out that the professor had actually written my name and id on the folder but not the other student's name. The student said that he did email the professor over a month ago telling him that he couldn't make all three normal midterms so he had to take the conflict for all of them. Since the proctor only had one copy of the exam, and my name was the one listed in the folder he gave me the copy of the exam. I decided I was taking the exam (even though ditching the exam would have not harmed me since I wasn't even enrolled in the course) and took the one copy they had, so the other student had no choice to leave. I'm not sure if the professor will give him another date or just give him a 0. \n\nI feel rather guilty and I think I should've let him take the exam instead of me. But again it was technically my name that was listed so it should've been my exam, but I feel rather uneasy since I didn't need the exam. \n\nFor those of you wondering how the exam went for me, it actually went pretty well.",
