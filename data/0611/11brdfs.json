And I get a free bus pass because I'm under 23) \n\nI've always been interested in psychology, criminology history etc and at the college I'm currently attending they have a year course that basically covers it all (including a few more things like geography, social anthropology, environment science and a few others).\n\nI'm going into animal care (currently the plan is zoo-keeping, however we will see where that takes me :)) so that other course will have no benefit to my future as I will not need it at all but should I take it for  the information? \n\nDefinitely a stupid question but just curious what others think",
