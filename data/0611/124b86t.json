  "concern": "I am a freshman biology major who is having a horrible time adjusting to different study methods and time management. I had to withdraw my first Chem lab my very first semester and now I’m failing my second general chemistry course and thinking of withdrawing and retaking for a better grade and rather get a W than a potential F. I am hoping to go to vet school but I’m worried how bad these grades will affect my chances. How bad is this?",
