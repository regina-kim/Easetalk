  "concern": "I had a question about coursework I’m currently a first year enrolled at a pretty prestigious private liberal arts college to be specific I general chemistry 2 is basically required for all science related majors here. I’m in gen chem 2 right now but I am struggling so much and I put everything into it. I was wondering if I took it at a community college if it’s like easier generally then a 4 year college. And just in general are classes easier at a community college then a 4 year one?",
