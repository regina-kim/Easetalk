  "concern": "I am pursuing an online university degree while also am a full-time regular college student. I am a straight A student all throughout high-school, and even my first year grades of my regular university course is stellar. But, even though I just finished 1 year of college, I had been selected for a much-coveted internship program and spent close to 5 months working on it online and all my summer working on site. Couple this with me being side-tracked with freshman year of college and being distracted (addicted) with reading a lot of books online & YouTube. \n\nAll of this leads to me not focusing on my online program at all and missing 4 courses completely. My overall GPA plummeted and suddenly I find myself suspended because I didn't pay attention to the online program. \n\nNow I am to write an appeal in less than 48 hrs. I have no idea what I should write and what not. This appeal decides whether I can continue this course or not.\n\nIf anyone has experience successfully appealing a college suspension, please be sure to give me tips on how to format my appeal too give me best chances.\n\nPlease help me out with this. This decides my entire future. ",
