  "concern": "Hi everyone\nI have this one subject that is called human biology and genetics. The book consists of 430 pages, it's in English and the exam will be in Dutch.\n\nI started summarizing, but it takes way too long. It feels like a waste of time because I forget almost everything after I'm done summarizing a (part of a) chapter. So I want to study straight out of the book to not waste my time anymore, but idk how. 430 is a lot of pages. Everything is so well written to the point that I feel like everything is important, but how will I manage to study, and remember 430 pages while I still have 5 other subjects I should focus on?\n\nI was wondering if there were some students who could give me some tips or advice? \nWhat would you guys do? \n\nThanks in advance! ðŸ˜Š",
