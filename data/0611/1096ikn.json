  "concern": "As an incoming 1L who recently graduated college, I realize that I did not always know the best way to set myself up for the best possible chance of getting into law school. In fact, because I figured it out so late, I believe I learned a few things that I wished I had done before.\n\n1. Study for the LSAT as soon as you can. Learning the test is a process because it is unlike any test you have had to take academically or standardized. The earlier you start, the more chance you give yourself to figure out your weaknesses and study over time without having to put as much pressure on yourself. I started late and did not do as well as I believe I could have.\n2. No matter what size your school is, try and get to know at least 2 professors on a personal level. Having professors help you with course selection and academic advice is useful for college itself, however, you will need LOR in the future and having professors that know your academic strengths and you as a person will help them write a more impressive LOR.\n3. Take classes that may expose you to the law to see if you are interested. People go to law school with a variety of different academic backgrounds, however most people get some electives that they can take. My suggestion is to take a constitutional law class, which although is not exactly same as what you will do in law school, it will introduce you to cases and concepts that will inform you of your interest in the topic. It will also prepare you for how to read court cases which may be difficult in the beginning.\n\nHope this helps, feel free to comment more tips if anyone has any.",
