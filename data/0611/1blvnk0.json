  "concern": "Not sure what exactly to flair this as, so I apologize if it’s wrong.\n\nBasically, my parents want me to defer my enrollment to my college of choice for a semester. They want me to work and do online school during that semester.\n\nI’m not sure a) if it’s a good idea or b) how to convince them to let me go to my choice college. I can’t just go (won’t be 18) and, since it’s a long ways away, probably won’t have any way to get there if they don’t let me go. \n\nIf I defer my enrollment, I’ll miss out on orientation for the college and its honor college, have issues with housing registration, and would miss out on most work-study opportunities. \n\nAlso, if I stay where I am and work for the semester, all of my money would be going to the online classes. I can’t save any of it, and I’d have to work full time.\n\nWhile my choice college would be the same price (for the semester), the minimum wage is higher and I’d only have to work 20-30 hours to cover the costs. \n\nI also would get financial aid from my choice, but not from the online school (I’d have to apply as a non-degree seeking student).\n\nI’m not too sure what to do or how to convince my parents. If this isn’t the right sub, please let me know. ",
