  "concern": "tw suicide mention \n\nTitle says it all. I joined my sorority during informal recruitment my sophomore year (last spring) and never really became close with anyone. I studied abroad last semester (maybe a bad idea in hindsight) and now it seems like I’m being excluded out of malicious intent. Yesterday was the cherry on top. Not gonna go into detail, but I went to an event and spoke to absolutely no one in my chapter. I feel like everyone hates me. It does take me a long time to warm up to people because I was severely bullied and abused K-12, and I wish with everything in me that I could fix it. After the event, I sobbed in my car while taking to my mom for an hour. I don’t want to bring the chapter down anymore. The only reason why I’m still in it is because it looks good on resumes. It’s honestly starting to make me suicidal. Any advice is appreciated. ",
