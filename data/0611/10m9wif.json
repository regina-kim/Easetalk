  "concern": "I’m a Freshman student at a very popular public university and I started my 2nd semester two weeks ago. During my whole time here I’ve not seemed able to make friends, when I first moved into the dorms everyone besides my roommate was already here for rushing and we’re all ready friends with each other. I’ve tried talking to people in my classes but they don’t seem interested on becoming friends and there isn’t really many groups that I’ve heard of to be apart of. It’s honestly making college harder because I literally have no one to talk to or hang out with on the weekends, I’m always just alone.",
