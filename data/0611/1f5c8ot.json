  "concern": "There is this one guy on our floor who is a Republican, and is making several others very uncomfortable.  Just to give you some examples:\n\n1.  He said that homoesxuality is a \"mental illness\" and gay people should drop out of college until they can be cured by a therapist. He has said this in front of gay students.\n\n2.  He calls immigrants \"invaders\" and says that they should \"go back to their country\".  He switched to a different discussion section for one of his classes because he wanted a TA who is white. \n\n3.  He is constantly complaining about how the university is \"violating his constitutional rights\" by not allowing him to bring his guns to campus. \n\n4.  He has MAGA posters on his wall, and wears Trump hats and shirts. \n\n5.  He is always trying to get people to go to church with him. Sometimes he is friendly, and says that his church is welcoming to everyone, and other times he is aggressive and tells us that we will burn in hell if we don't go. \n\nWe have complained to our RA, who said they can't do anything because he hasn't broken any rules. We also spoke to the housing director who took a report and then said \"he is entitled to his opinion\".  His roommate moved out after 2 days so now he has his own room, but the rest of the people on the floor are also getting tired of him. Does anyone have any advice?",
