  "concern": "Ive always dreamed of leaving the state and attending a musical theatre college to pursue my dreams, but im scared to apply to the colleges I want to because my roommate and best friend who took me in when I struggled living with my parents says he is not ready to move away with me. I have always hoped he could come with me but I think ive always known deep down he was never going to. I dont usually pour my feelings out on social media but when he brought this up to me, I felt so much anger and frustration and sadness and pain. I can't imagine leaving him behind after he has provided such a comfortable life for me, not to mention my pets and sister who is still with my mom. I feel so distraught when I think about leaving all by myself because I had always hoped I could have my best friend come with me. I'm so scared that we will drift apart, even though we have been friends all throughout middle and highschool. I dont really have any other friends, maybe a few coworkers I talk to at work, but he is the only person I can say is genuinely close to me. I worry I wont bond with anyone like I did him when I leave for college and will only remain close acquaintances with potential college friends. Everywhere I look online I see the same things about taking opportunities to meet new people and not dwell on past relationships, staying in touch when you have time, but the thought alone makes me so incredibly upset. I haven't even applied to any of my dream colleges yet and im sitting here crying thinking about the outcomes, even though I dont know if I will even get in or attend these colleges until the fall. Im so angry and upset that he won't come with me but at the same time Im so upset at the thought that I will miss him terribly. Part of me feels like losing touch is inevitable and I dont know how to handle it. He and his family has done so much for me and to just move on and forget that feels so wrong. Before we started living together, I felt so incredibly alone and I dont want to feel so isolated again. Im coping terribly at the thought alone and I have no clue how i'll even manage to cope. I dont want to put my whole life on hold to wait and move on until he's ready too, but doing what I want to do feels so painful.",
