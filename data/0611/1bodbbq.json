  "concern": "Alright let me lay this out for you, we have a group of 4 people who were trying to select our housing for the upcoming year. When we tried to select the desired building/room it said it was not avalible(Meaning no more rooms avalible). However after speaking with freshman, they were able to select these over us a WEEK after we did housing selection.\n\nKeep in mind we are all Juniors at the university. The university did mention there was a bug in the system prior to this selection which is why it was pushed back to start.\n\nI guess Im looking for any ideas on how we could go about to try and get the housing that was almost gureented to us due to credit standings.  (We have just about accpeted our fate, this was my final hope...)",
