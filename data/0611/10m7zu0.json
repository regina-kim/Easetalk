  "concern": "I'm attending a Community College currently, and my sister recommended me to check out work-study. I'm wondering if it's worth it? My GPA is sitting at 2.3 right now so I don't know if they'd hire me or not.  Level 2 jobs pay 14.75 hourly while level 1 jobs pay 14.25. I'm not sure of the hours, because I think it depends on each job, but I've seen something around 20 hours a week. Does anyone here have any advice or tips when it comes to work-study? If you worked on campus, did you have a positive or negative experience? Thanks guys!",
