  "concern": "I want to have better grades I want to succeed in life but it is literally IMPOSSIBLE for me to be motivated. I’ve already put in so much work into my academic career and none of it has paid off, I was forced to go to community college with a 4.0 gpa in highschool. I slaved away for the first year of college (taking 7 classes together at one point) just to have 2 teachers cuck me out of straight A’s because they were lazy graders. Not only am I an academic failure, but also a social failure (no gf, ugly, no friends) and because of that I am miserable 90% of the time (the other 10% where i’m happy is when I completely disassociate with life and either sleep or play video games). My brain and body has reached some sort of “breaking point” where I literally just can’t bring myself to do any more work towards my academics. I’ve always approached school with this mentality of “suffer now and enjoy yourself later” but the suffering is just non-stop. Because of this I have literally become too lazy to do anything. How can I break out of this mental prison? I get moments where I want to START doing work but 3 minutes in I just give up. If I cannot figure out how to fix this soon I might actually have to kill myself because my life would be irredeemably fucked forever. ",

Despite that, I still feel stuck and unmotivated in both my academic and personal life.\ntherapist: It's great that you've taken the initiative to reach out for support from the school's therapists. Sometimes, it can take a while to see the benefits of therapy, so don't lose hope just yet. I understand that feeling stuck and unmotivated can be frustrating, but remember that small steps and progress, no matter how small, are still progress. Have you considered setting small, achievable goals for yourself to help you regain a sense of control and motivation?\nclient: I've thought about setting small goals to try and build some momentum, but I end up feeling overwhelmed and giving up quickly. It's frustrating because I know it could help, yet my ongoing lack of motivation keeps pulling me back into that cycle of inaction.\ntherapist: It seems like you're aware of the potential benefits of setting small goals but are finding it challenging to follow through due to feelings of overwhelm and a lack of motivation. This can be a common struggle for many people. Have you considered discussing strategies to overcome these obstacles with your school therapist? They may be able to provide guidance and support tailored to your specific situation.\nclient: I've already discussed some strategies with my school therapist, but I still struggle with the overwhelming lack of motivation that keeps derailing my efforts. It's frustrating how even knowing what might help doesn't make it easier to follow through.\ntherapist: It's clear that you've been putting in effort to improve your situation, but it's also evident that finding the right strategies to maintain motivation remains a challenge. It might be helpful to explore different approaches or techniques to address the lack of motivation. Remember that everyone's journey is unique, and sometimes it takes a bit of trial and error to find what works best for you. Is there any specific activity or interest that you find joy in or that sparks a sense of motivation, even if it's just a small amount?\nclient: I find a bit of joy in playing video games, as it helps me escape and forget about my failures for a while, but even that quickly loses its appeal and doesn't motivate me to tackle my responsibilities. Sleeping is another small escape that offers temporary relief, yet it leaves me feeling even more drained and unmotivated afterward.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you seek relief in activities like video games and sleep, but it seems that the temporary relief they provide doesn't translate into lasting motivation. While it's important to have outlets for relaxation, it might be helpful to explore ways to channel the small moments of joy or satisfaction you find in these activities into other areas of your life. Have you considered setting small, achievable goals related to your academic pursuits or personal life that could help build a sense of accomplishment and motivate you to take further steps?\nclient: I've tried setting small goals before, like starting with just one homework assignment, but I quickly lose steam and end up feeling even more defeated. It seems like no matter how achievable I make them, the underlying lack of motivation overrides any potential sense of accomplishment.\ntherapist: It's evident that setting small goals hasn't been effective in maintaining motivation for you. Perhaps we can explore the possibility of finding an accountability partner or seeking additional support from your school therapist to help you stay on track. Sometimes, having someone to share your progress with or receive encouragement from can make a difference in sustaining motivation. Would you be open to discussing these options with your school therapist or considering other sources of support?\nclient: I'm open to discussing options like an accountability partner with my school therapist, as I'm desperate for something to change. However, I'm concerned that my persistent lack of motivation might make it hard to follow through.\ntherapist: Your concerns are valid, and it's essential to acknowledge the challenges you might face in following through with new strategies. However, it's also important to remember that change doesn't happen overnight, and small, incremental steps can lead to significant progress over time. As you continue to explore different approaches, try to be kind to yourself and celebrate even the smallest victories. With the support of your school therapist and the possibility of an accountability partner, you may find that your motivation gradually improves.\nclient: I appreciate the reminder to be kind to myself, but I'm worried that without some immediate external push, like that accountability partner, I'll keep slipping back into old habits. I'll try to focus on those small steps with my school therapist to see if it helps build momentum.\ntherapist: Focusing on small steps and considering an accountability partner are great starting points. It's important to remember that building new habits and overcoming challenges takes time and patience.

With persistence and self-compassion, you can make meaningful progress toward your goals.\nclient: I understand the importance of patience in building habits, but I'm still struggling with the constant pull back into disengagement and need to push forward with finding an accountability partner soon. I'll keep working on those small steps as we discussed, hoping it sparks the motivation I've been missing.\ntherapist: It's great that you're committed to finding an accountability partner to support your progress. While you continue your search, remember that even small efforts to stay engaged and focused on your goals are valuable steps forward. Building motivation is a process, and each small action contributes to your overall progress.
