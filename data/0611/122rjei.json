  "concern": "I am a second year student who didn't have any issues doing okay before this semester. I feel like for my current courses I am putting in the work (or am under the impression that I am) and still not seeing results. For two of my midterms I just got back, I barely passed both of them (52%) and the class average was around 67% for both.. I have never been below the average in any of my assessments before, and I walked out of the exams thinking I would at least get a 70% or even 80% for one of them. I am freaking out because I have really never gotten to this point in my courses having such low marks. I can't drop them, and I am sure I will probably pass but with very low marks. I want to do well on the finals, but I also I feel so discouraged.\n\nI studied for the midterms and thought I was fine but a lot worse than I felt. As unrealistic as it is, I want to get as close to acing my finals as I can but I feel like it's so out of reach when I look at how badly I did on my midterms. It feels like even if I feel like I am ready for the final, I probably am not ready based on how wrong I was last time. Idk I am just in such a bad place right now and I don't know what to do.",
