  "concern": "I understand that it can take some time getting used to someone with different habits than you, but it’s not getting any better and I don’t know what to do. \n\nI didn’t know my roommate beforehand. My university used RoomSync, which is kind of like a dating app where you swipe through profiles with basic roommate preferences. She requested to be my roommate before even talking, which I thought was a little weird, so I started a conversation. We barely texted over the summer, nothing more than living preferences, who brings what, and basic interests. This probably should have been an indicator that we wouldn’t be super close. \n\nWhen we got here, she asked if it was ok if she FaceTimed her friends. Sure, I don’t care. I didn’t realize she meant every second that she wasn’t sleeping or in the bathroom (which is in our dorm - so happy there’s no communal bathroom). I made it clear before we agreed to be roommates that I need silence when I’m studying. I can’t focus with a lot of talking or noise in the background. She said the same thing. Yet, now she’s always talking while she’s studying. I can’t concentrate, so I have to go out to the lounge area by the elevators to study every night. She does leave when she notices I’m about to go to bed (I have to 8 AM’s, twice a week), which is nice, but I feel like if she studies better with noise, she should go study outside of the room. I’ve never directly asked her to leave, just subtle reminders that I need it to be quiet when studying. I don’t want to start conflict, and this is her room too, but it’s also my room, and I don’t think I can do this for a whole year. I also wonder why she told me she studied in silence too, when she doesn’t. Maybe this is really pushing it too far, but I honestly wonder if she didn’t just say that so she could have a quiet roommate who wasn’t always talking, as to not interfere with her always talking on the phone. \n\nI was really hoping I’d get a roommate that I could be friends with since I’m not great at making friends. I’m really shy, but I’m the type of person that if you start the conversation, I’m great at talking. I’m just too scared/awkward to go up to someone and start talking first. My roommate made it clear the day we got here that she didn’t want to talk or be friends. We never talk, other than occasionally asking when the other person is getting up/going to bed, or when she’s coming back since she usually goes home for the weekend. \n\nOn top of the studying issues, she always turns the lights on when she gets up before me (3 times a week), which wakes me up. I understand that she needs light to see and get ready, but she even leaves them on when she showers. Why do you need the kitchen and vanity lights on when you’re in the bathroom for half an hour? (Note: the vanity lights is for the bathroom sink, which is outside of the bathroom that has the toilet and shower.) This isn’t as big of an issue, I’ve semi-gotten used to it. Now I just go to bed with the blanket over my face, it’s just kind of annoying. \n\nPlus, now she’s stopped doing her chores. We agreed that I’d vacuum, take the trash out (main big one + little bathroom one), and clean the shower every week, while she would clean the toilet, both sinks, and Swiffer every other week. The sinks are always dirty (you know the soap residue that builds up on the faucet), and she keeps wiping the mirror down, but leaves awful streaks that you can barely see your reflection, so I have to rewipe it. I don’t know about the toilet, maybe she does it when I’m not there, and maybe she Swiffers, but I never see a Swiffer pad in the trash, so I don’t think so? This also isn’t a huge deal, it only takes me a couple of minutes to watch the sinks and mirror, but it’s just kind of annoying because it is her room too. \n\nThe main problem is the constant FaceTiming, but these other little things just build onto it. I’m really starting to dislike her, which I don’t want to, but she’s getting on my nerves. I know things could be worse, I’ve heard some roommate horror stories. One friend I’ve made that’s a junior told me how unlucky one of her friends was as a freshman, which my case isn’t nearly as bad. I know part of the problem is because I haven’t said anything, I just don’t want to start something knowing that I probably can’t get a different room. I really want a different roommate next semester, but if I say something to the RA and the change can’t happen, then it’ll just be awkward if she finds out. Should I say something? How should I say it? I don’t know what to do. ",
