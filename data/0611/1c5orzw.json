  "concern": "Okay so I commute a half hour (45-60 mins to the college campus at most)\n\nI have made some connections, but I don’t know if they are good enough. \n\nI like and hate the idea of having a dorm and room. Not because I am a shy introvert, but I just don’t really know to feel about the idea of living on a college campus. Several reasons for that. \n\nOverall:\nI like the privacy.\nI like my home. \nI like living with my family and dog.\nI don’t want to spend more money. \nI think I probably focus better at home. \nI’m kind of uncomfortable living elsewhere especially on that campus. \n\nI’m considering possibly moving to an apartment for my second year or a later year in college or near it but I don’t know if I want to just yet. I am in state so I have a home and live with my family which is nice and I like it, but the commute can be tiring and long also it is harder to attend late night club events. But the college campus area isn’t the best and safest place (suburban/urban college city/town) although it is a large 4 year university the location is in an area I don’t really like. \n\nI would say the exact college, but I don’t think I can do that here.
