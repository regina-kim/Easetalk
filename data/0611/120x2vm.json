  "concern": "Good Afternoon/Good Morning/Good Night everyone,\n\nI am in my second term at my college as a CS major, and I've noticed some changes in my mental health. Last semester I felt extremely motivated, trying new things, joining clubs, and getting homework done on time. This semester I've basically quit most of my clubs and now I'm starting to fall behind a bit in my math skills and I'm just a lot more stressed out than usual. I cried for the first time in a year a few days ago for 15 minutes because I miss my mother who's now living in the south but I'm all the way up north. Is there anything I can do to help improve my work ethic? I really want to get my degree because I really love computers and want to pursue a career involving them but the pressure is becoming too much!",
