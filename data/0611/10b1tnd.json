  "concern": "I’m a senior in college doing a dual degree (not a double major) in Computer Science and Biomathematics. I was supposed to graduate in the summer for both but I wasn’t able to get into a Physics 1 course this spring, that I need to take Physics 2 in the summer, which means I will be delayed a whole semester because of one class. With the classes im taking right now in the spring I finish my CS degree, and then I have 2 clases left plus physics 1 and 2 for my BM degree. My question is: can i graduate from my CS bachelor before the BM? It feels like a waste that now I have to wait until the end of the year to finish when I have almost nothing left, and I also don’t want to just waste all my work these 4 years and not do BM. At least graduating from CS I can get a decent job and not waste all those months\nAny advice is appreciated!!",
