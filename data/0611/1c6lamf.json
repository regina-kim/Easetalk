  "concern": "TL; DR: Title. As a binary trans person not active in the LGBTQ community it makes me uncomfortable. Would I be canceled/hated by the people in my college if I did so?\n\nSorry if this isn't the right subreddit for this but I couldn't find a better one. I am going to a school in NY(which I hear is a generally pretty progressive state) and I am from the south.\n\nI am trans/gay, but I really don't like talking about it that much. I mean I'll talk about relationships and hot people/characters I like but the subject of my conversations will never really revolve around how prideful I am in my sexuality/gender. Maybe it's because I'm from the south--and I'm fine with LGBTQ people--I just don't really like the people super active in the LGBTQ community because they make me uncomfortable. Especially the neopronouns/neogenders crowd. I was made fun of for being trans by other kids and called an \"it\" or asked if I identified as a cat/dog and how that meant it was okay to sh//t me. And it really dehumanized me--it's a part of my life I don't particularly want shoved in my face every day even if I'm okay speaking up for myself or talking about only occasionally.\n\nI try to be an accepting person. And I do not hate the neopronouns/neogenders crowd, but being around them makes me uncomfortable so I tend to steer clear. Although I firmly believe you should I what makes you happy I do not think these things are rooted in a medically necessary basis the same way gender dysphoria is. And I worry they would hate me for that belief even if I were to accept/respect them as people regardless of what I think.\n\nIf I put it out there that I didn't really wanna room with people like that would everyone get mad at me for being exclusionary? My school isn't that large and I don't want to have a tough time with the few people I get the opportunity to make friends with.",
