Would I get college completely free? and would a bank loan me the remaining with my score/savings/income? That grants and gov won’t cover? And attend a elite college like UCLA or USC? Or do all these people who go to college have parents to live with and roommates? Or huge savings accounts? Just wondering if I can in my situation or should I pursue a better job and forget about college? \nI have kids too will I see them much if I work and go to college? Any recommendations, your experiences anyone who dropped out and made it? \n\nThanks”\n\nHe was to embarrassed to post himself but I advised him to just find a job that pays him without a degree, he will never be home and tends to get bored fast in same environments. Calls out of work and lags sometimes as it is. Is college life for him? He thinks he can survive and get in free at this point, I think he’s having a phase where he thinks he can cram this in. I just think he will get extremely tired maintaining a home and college life.",

  "dialogue_conv": "therapist: Hey there, how are you feeling today? Is there anything on your mind that you'd like to talk about?\nclient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed today with some decisions about my future. Yes, I'd like to talk about whether going back to school is feasible for me right now.\ntherapist: It sounds like you've got some big decisions on your mind. Navigating the future can be overwhelming, especially when it comes to something as significant as going back to school. What are some of the factors that are making you question whether it's feasible for you right now?\nclient: I'm worried about my financial situation and work schedule making it hard to balance with school, especially with family responsibilities like my kids. Plus, I'm concerned about staying motivated and avoiding burnout in a demanding routine.\ntherapist: That's a lot to consider. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Balancing school, work, finances, family, and self-care is a challenging task. Perhaps we can break these concerns down a bit. Which of these factors feels like the most pressing one for you right now?\nclient: The financial situation feels like the most pressing factor right now, as it directly impacts my ability to manage everything else. I'm also worried about how it might affect my family time and motivation to keep going.\ntherapist: It seems that your financial situation is causing significant stress and affecting your ability to manage multiple responsibilities. Exploring potential solutions and resources to alleviate some of these financial concerns might help you feel more in control. Can you tell me more about your current financial situation and how it might impact your decision to return to school?\nclient: I'm currently dealing with tight finances from high living costs and limited income, which makes it hard to cover everything without added stress. This situation is making me hesitant about returning to school, as I'm worried it would further strain my family time and overall motivation to keep up with everything.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're facing some difficult decisions, and it's important to consider the potential impact on your family time and motivation. Financial strain can certainly add to the stress of managing multiple responsibilities. Have you looked into any financial aid or scholarship opportunities that might help alleviate the burden of returning to school?\nclient: I've looked into some financial aid and scholarship options, but they don't seem to fully address my current constraints. This uncertainty is making me even more concerned about how adding school would affect my family time and overall energy.\ntherapist: It's understandable that financial uncertainty can add to the stress of managing multiple responsibilities. While financial aid and scholarships may not fully address your concerns, exploring alternative solutions might help ease some of the burdens. Have you considered part-time studies or online courses as a way to balance school with your work and family commitments?\nclient: I've considered part-time studies and online courses as options, but I'm concerned they might still strain my family time and energy due to my current financial and work demands. This makes me hesitant about whether they would truly help in the long run.\ntherapist: It seems like you're carefully weighing the pros and cons of various options, considering the potential impact on your family and personal well-being. It's important to make decisions that feel manageable and sustainable for you. Is there any additional support or resources you think might help alleviate some of these concerns and make the idea of returning to school more feasible?\nclient: I've considered seeking guidance from a financial counselor to better manage my budget and resources. Additionally, exploring flexible scheduling options through the school might help me maintain a balance with work and family commitments.\ntherapist: Seeking guidance from a financial counselor and exploring flexible scheduling options with the school seem like great steps towards addressing your concerns. It's important to remember that finding a balance between your responsibilities and personal well-being is key to making this decision. Would you like to discuss how these resources might be helpful in your specific situation?\nclient: Yes, I'd like to discuss how a financial counselor and flexible scheduling could help me manage my work and family commitments without adding too much strain. This might clarify if pursuing school is truly feasible for me right now.\ntherapist: Great! Let's start by talking about how a financial counselor can assist you. They can provide valuable guidance on budgeting and managing your resources effectively. This may help alleviate some of your financial concerns and create a clearer picture of what's financially feasible for you and your family. Additionally, they can offer advice on financial aid options and scholarships that could potentially ease the burden of tuition costs.\n\n That sounds helpful. Having a better understanding of my finances and the options available would definitely make it easier to see if going back to school is a viable choice. What about flexible scheduling?\n\n Flexible scheduling can be a great way to balance your work, family, and school commitments. Many schools offer options like part-time enrollment, online courses, or evening classes. These alternatives could allow you to continue working and spending time with your family while still pursuing your education. It's important to reach out to the school and discuss what options are available, so you can find a schedule that works best for you.\n\n I appreciate that. Knowing there are different scheduling options available makes the idea of returning to school less overwhelming. I'll look into these resources and see how they can help me make a more informed decision.\nclient: I appreciate the insights on scheduling options, as they could help me balance my work and family without overwhelming my daily routine. Still, I'm concerned about maintaining energy for everything, given my current commitments.\ntherapist: That's understandable.

Here are a few suggestions to consider\n\n- Create a schedule that includes dedicated time for relaxation and personal interests, ensuring you have moments to recharge.\n- Practice time-management techniques, such as prioritizing tasks and breaking larger projects into smaller, manageable steps.\n- Establish boundaries between your work, family, and school responsibilities to prevent one area from consuming all your energy.\n- Seek support from friends, family, or even a counselor to share your concerns and feelings, as they can provide valuable encouragement and advice.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to maintain a balance between your responsibilities and personal well-being to avoid burnout.

I'm still concerned about whether I'll sustain this balance with my current work and family demands while pursuing school.\ntherapist: It's natural to have these concerns, and it's important to remember that maintaining balance is an ongoing process.
