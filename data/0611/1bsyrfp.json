  "concern": "Do you ever feel like you are not retaining anything from college, or have you felt regret that you are just getting by?\n\nThe beginning of freshman year I would study for an exam, then I swear the second it’s done the concepts dissapear from my mind entirely. I then told myself it’s not worth it study information I am just going to inevitably forget. So, I stopped studying entirely. I developed a habit of cheating in my classes, the quizzes, exams. I have CHATGBT do my assignments/essays, and then I just reword and edit it all. I feel like I’m the only person who does this. \n\nI am now a 3rd year psychology major at university, still majoring in psychology, and my grades are good. BUT the realization just hit me that I could barely tell you anything about psychology, let alone any other classes. Like, at all. I can’t tell you the last time I sat down to read a textbook or complete an assignment on my own. \n\nI have literally cheated my way through college. \n\nI feel an enormous amount of regret, guilt, and anger at myself for going about my entire university career in this manner. I am going to graduate university next year, and I won’t even be deserving of the degree. Given I have gone through significant mental health challenges the past years, but that is no excuse.\n\nI want to retake all my courses, but that’s so pricey and unrealistic. I want to start taking my classes seriously because despite it not appearing so I really do care about psychology. \n. \nMy therapist tell me post-graduation is 5% what you learned from college. and 95% the skills you learn on the job. But I’m just panicking. I don’t know what to do. Has anyone been in a similar situation?\n",
