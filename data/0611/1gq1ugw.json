Unfortunately, I am acutely aware of how much they truly hate us, at least most of them! Maybe it's better for grad students? Then, I made a gargantuan mistake by joining their Reddit group r/Professors. The same can be said for the r/AskProfessors . It's so very depressing! I keep praying that my professors are different \n\nThey spew the meanest things about their students on these communities. In r/Professors we can't even respond or post, and on r/AskProfessors students can't post without content review. So, let's have our own COLLEGE STUDENTS ONLY community where we forbid comments/posts when we share the REAL order of things. Thoughts? ",
