  "concern": "So I'm a first gen, and I have no idea what half the terms I find when looking up college information mean, and I find myself lost more often than not. Other than my family I have no real connections, and the only person that went to college in my family is my brother who quit part way through and is stuck with student loans. Is there anywhere I can go for help?\n\nThere's also something specific that just confuses and stuns me. Most help or scholarships I've found involve previous experience with community service or an essay about how you plan to make a difference. I don't plan on making a difference man, I just want to learn how to do what I love so I don't end up in a soul sucking dead end job. I just want to make character design and video games for a living, I'm not looking to help some group or anything, I just want a decent job and life.\n\nI dunno I'm just confused about all this, I just wanna learn man.",
