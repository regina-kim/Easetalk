  "concern": "So maybe I’m having a mid life crisis or something but I needed some options. I am 31 f currently in nursing school. I am doing so horrible and on the verge of flunking and this is my first semester. I have an associates in applied science and my whole job experience is medical related. Idk if it’s the frustration and defeating talking but seeing what nurses are responsible and in charge of is making me rethink my whole career plan. I thought this is what I wanted but now I’m having second thoughts, I feel like I’m too old to change career paths and even if I wanted to I have zero experience in other departments. I have kids and shit to maintain so I can’t just keep taking classes unless they are gonna help me excel. Idk what to do, I’ve never felt like this before. On one hand if I become a nurse there are so many different departments you can get into, but on the other hand idk if I’m telling myself that as comfort because I’m too scared to admit it’s not what I want. I just need some advice on maybe what I can do.",
