This happens with people outside my major as well. its almost like i cant see myself connecting with anyone there.\n\ni even have close friends who attend the same uni even they won't message or hangout with me when i reach out to them.\n\nDay by day i've been losing motivation to study as well and literally killing myself to get good grades since i need a specific GPA to move onto the next year. \n\nand its suffocating in my dorm as well, living on campus is awful.\n\ni'm just lost and feel like this everyday with my mental health deteriorating and i hate it so much, there's so many things i wanna accomplish yet i'm stuck in this mindset. \n\nid really like some advice if anyone could offer some, is college really the best years of your life like most say it is?\n\n&#x200B;",
