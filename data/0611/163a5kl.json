  "concern": "Biology is my 2nd worst subject. This is a fast-paced hybrid class, so we only meet once a week for labs and exams. I'm so stressed out that I won't be able to remember all this information since my brain isn't.. the best? I have an IEP (individualized education program) where it's meant for students who just need the extra help and time when it comes to their assignments & tests. \n\nAfter my first day of biology and everyone left, I just started having a panic attack because of all the information about the class that was thrown at me. My professor noticed & asked if I was okay. I couldn't breathe and he told me to \"let it all out\". Once I was able to catch my breath, I told him how my brain functions differently and it just works slower compared to others. He kept asking me how he can help me, and told me to go to the counselor's office to get accommodations for my IEP so when I take the lab and lecture exams, I'll get extra time. I'm thankful he's understanding and he stopped me from feeling embarrassed.\n\nI've always had an IEP on my student file, but I've never once used the accommodations because I want to learn without the extra help, but I think this time I finally need to use it because I am not confident in biology at all.\n\nI just need to pass with a C minimum so it transfers overs to the University. I always study my hardest where I don't overload my brain with information, but Biology is a crazy amount of memorizing. I chose the seat closest to my professor's desk and I'm going to ask him a lot of questions. I really want to pass this class with a C, I don't think it's possible for me to get anything higher than that because my brain sucks. I wish I had a normal brain.\n\nI'm extremely worried, my emotional health has gotten so much worse ever since my first day of biology class on Friday. I hope my professor sees that I'm really trying and will go a little bit easier/lenient on me, and that is never something I EVER expect because life isn't always easy in the real world. It's just the fact that this is the only science class I will ever have to take for the rest of my college education.",
