  "concern": "I\"m a dual USA-Canadian citizen accepted to environmental science as freshman at both Penn State and U Toronto.  With a scholarship, the cost is very similar for me at both school. (difference of 4-5K a year including travelling/miscellaneous expenses).   I'm torn between the two.  I'm in state for Penn State and U Toronto is 8 hours away.  But I'm trying to choose the better program and prospect for graduate school, and don't worry as much about the distance as I have family near both schools.  Thank you in advance for any advice you can give me, especially from a student perspective.",
