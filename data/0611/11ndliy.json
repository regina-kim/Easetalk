It's a long road and I thought I was ready and I want it more than anything but holy shit I'm so scared something will go wrong. I'm scared I don't have what it takes or I don't stand out enough. I'm a freshman and I think I'm doing well but I keep getting that intrusive feeling. Anyone else feel like this? Is this normal? Will it start to make sense soon?",
