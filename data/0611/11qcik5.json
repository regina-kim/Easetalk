I done 9 modules over the course of 5 semesters. We graduated from that course in 2021 and immediately went into another one which I'm due to graduate having had to do every module in May.\n\nI didn't receive my parchment in November of 2021 like everybody else in my class. Months went by and I still didn't receive it, so I emailed my department in February of 2022. I got an email back saying it would take a bit of paperwork as they had to combine the results from when I was there in the early 2010s and the part-time course I done. I waited a few months and e-mailed again in May of 2022 and was told leave it with them. Frustrating, but I was still in no rush as I still had a year left in my new course. \n\nIt's now nearly a year and a half since I should've received that parchment and I'm due to graduate the other course in two months or so. I've two emails written out, one angry demanding one to my department, and one nice one to the awards office basically burying my department. Which one should I send?\n\nI've mad anxiety, that's why I haven't sent any.",
