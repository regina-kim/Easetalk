  "concern": "I am a graduating senior, and I am incredibly disappointed in my college experience. I didn’t make any friends in college, got denied from every club, got denied from every club sports, and got denied from every frat. I could never successfully secure party invites or invites to other social events. It was incredibly lonely and depressing.\n\nI also did poorly academically. Even with intense studying, I can never perform at the level needed. Office hours don’t help. I never made any connections with any professors. I couldn’t get any internships in college and struggle to find any jobs after college.\n\nIt was incredibly disappointing, and I genuinely felt I wasted my time in college",
