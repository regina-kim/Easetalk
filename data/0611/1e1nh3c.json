  "concern": "For context, I (20F) live in Dallas, TX. I started studying for an associate's in cybersecurity in August 2022 and I am set to graduate in May 2025. However, I have had a change of heart and I don't see myself working in tech anymore. I've considered taking a summer off to find a job, but my parents are very adamant about me going to a 4-year for a bachelor's.\n\nI've been thinking about going to university and studying Human Resources Management. I have some of my core classes done, but the cybersecurity AS itself is an independent degree and not meant to be transferrable. If I went to university, I would have to spend 3-4 more years there because none of the cybersecurity classes would transfer over. I would be graduating in 2028 or 2029 at 25, while my former classmates would be graduating in 2026 at 22.\n\nI'm at a crossroads here. What should I do?",
