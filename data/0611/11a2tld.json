  "concern": "So….I got a bachelors degree with a good GPA. After college I attended a community college to pursue an additional associates and ended up getting an F and a W on my transcript (for a long winded reason) and didn’t go back. \n\nI want to get my masters online and was wondering, is it possible for the admissions to be unaware of my one community college semester if I don’t submit the transcript ? I didn’t receive financial aid and paid out of pocket. And if they would know I went there without me disclosing it, how would they find that out?",
