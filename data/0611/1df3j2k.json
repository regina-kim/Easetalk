  "concern": "Hi, I was accepted to a college with a tuition cost of 5k a year direct costs(after scholarships, school and federal grants, 3k a year in work study, and $5,500 in federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans).\n\n I'm considering working 15-20 hours a week on top of school to help pay for it, (I have $2,000 in savings, plus I want to pay off as much of the federal loans as I can), would this be too much/stressful? I don't want to take out a private loan. But I know indirect costs (books, transportation/travel and personal expenses) at my school are an estimated $3,500. What is the best course of action for me at this point? Any insight or experiences would be amazing.\n\nI have already filed the FAFSA, with my SAI being -1500. I also have an electric bike for my transportation around the city, but flights to and from my family is around $300 each time.",
