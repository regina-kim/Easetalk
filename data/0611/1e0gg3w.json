  "concern": "Hello,\n\nBasically I hear that PolySci is a highly versatile major and I’m very interested in the politics of this world but I’ve always wanted to get into business. I chose PolySci mainly because I’ve been avoiding taking Stats in CC which is required for a business admin. major but I’ve learned I’m not skilled in this part of college and I’m not a math expert and the class really pushes me to my limit. But it’s only when I researched PolySci there’s lots for me to do that I enjoy doing but I don’t know how well the market for this major is and I want to play it safe knowing I can still get into business with this. I also considered marketing, accounting and economics but I already have switched my career path so much I’m tired of bombarding my advisor with indecisiveness and I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t be able to just take a liberal arts math like I’m doing this fall. Unless I can that would be great. I’m just trying to see if employers are going to still be interested in me if I had a degree in PolySci because it’s what I’m sticking to right now. I know it can be versatile but it shows I’ll be very limited in what I do but I’m fine with that  I’m confident in my capabilities and just because I’m not strong in math it doesn’t mean I won’t be able to contribute. I’m more of a communicator than an analyst and I just want to see what options I have to be able to help businesses expand but part of the reason I chose PolySci is because a government job or even law as second option would be satisfying to me but I don’t know if Im able to afford higher education at this time. I need a bachelors in something that won’t force me to do a lot of math but still be able to communicate business needs. If anyone here has any clue on what I should do I’m open to your guys’s thoughts ",
