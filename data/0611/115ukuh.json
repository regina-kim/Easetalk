  "concern": "Hi :)\nI'm currently a high school senior preparing for my freshmen year of college. I am currently planning to go to community college, as it works the best for me financially and in regards to my major. I am planning to move out, but there's going to be a lot in my plate. I need to move out - I have many problems with my family and cannot get anything done in this house because of the traumas and abuse I've experienced here. I'm planning to double major in either Music Preformance and Music Education, or Music Preformance and Political Science. In both these fields, connections and relationships are extremely important, so I was hoping to get a job related to my music field and an internship related to political science. I already have availabilities with the internships, but my main concern is if I will be able to do it all. I don't really have anyone who I can ask and has gone through this experience. Will moving out, double majoring, working, and having an internship be too much to handle? I'm very independent and I'm hoping to get a couple roommates (i don't understand how renting apartments work but I'll do research). I also took the IB Diploma course so I'm hoping that has prepared me in some way for the college work? I'm not sure what to do/if I will be able to handle it and was hoping to get opinions from people who have had the college experience :)\n\nThank you so much for reading !! :)",
