  "concern": "I’m in my second semester as a college freshman and took a sociology course this semester. After about 3 weeks in, I didn’t really understand it and felt lost. We didn’t have any significant assignments so my grade was an 86 but I still felt like I wasn’t grasping the assignments, and I felt lost in every group assignment, and that my grade was going to suffer eventually. I also feel terrible because now my family doesn’t get a refund because it’s been a couple weeks into the course. Did I do the wrong thing? I feel like I’ve let everybody down.",
