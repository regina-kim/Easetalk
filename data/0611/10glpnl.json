  "concern": "So I have a triple dorm (the third roommate never showed up), and my roommate is constantly out of the dorm past 10 am. I on the contrary enjoy staying inside. I do all of my studying in my dorm room as I don't feel comfortable working in front of people in the lounge or the library. I do go out for my lectures/labs, to eat, and for an hour or two to practice in a music room each day. If the weather is okay I will also go out on a hiking trail for a few hours. \n\nI do go home for the weekends so my roommate gets to have the dorm for herself during the weekends, but I see no sense in studying outside of my dorm room. I am currently working on getting an internship, but before I get a part-time position, I will likely continue being a homebody. Is this weird or do others here also prefer to sit in their dorm rooms? I am a STEM major, so I do have to study more than my business major roommate.",
