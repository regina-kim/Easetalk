  "concern": "Im a senior this year with a 3.85 GPA. I’m taking a course right now that is really challenging me, and I am terrified of making a B or lower. I have to take it for my major but it isn’t really my forte of work. Is it really the end of the world if I don’t make an A or high B in a course this late in the game? I’m probably overreacting but need realistic answers of how important this part of my academic career is or some reassurance. I have been experiencing some pretty severe anxiety of having to do everything I can to maintain my GPA, so I feel like this is crucial to that. TIA!",
