  "concern": "Hi guys, \n\nI'm currently a 3rd-year psych student and when I was younger I always thought about what it would be like to be a pharmacist etc. etc. but I was never very good at chemistry or sciences in general so I chose to stick with humanities through high school and then now in university. I work at a pharmacy as an assistant lol and I do love the courses I'm doing right now but there's always this little thought in the back of my head of what if I switched or what if that's what I should be doing. \n\nI'm gonna talk to an advisor next week about what my best course of action is but I just came here for some advice - is it too late to switch? Should I even bother if I'm this far into my degree? Is there a different route I can take?\n\nI think It's probably a little far-fetched for me to be thinking I can switch but I'm open to hearing anything. \n\nCheers!",
