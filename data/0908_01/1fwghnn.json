  "concern": "As the title says my roommate doesn’t clean up after themself. Now our room isn’t a complete disaster and it’s mainly their side (plus our bathroom but it’s kinda 70/30 on who makes the most mess of it) but they just don’t really clean up. They have cups and cans and bottles all over their nightstand and desk and have even had a cup under their bed on the dresser before, and they’re never empty either. They also go home every weekend so they don’t really have dishes or real food here so they’re all Starbucks and Dunkin’ cups, so half full coffees just sitting there separating for weeks as they go home and come back. They do sorta clean it after a few weeks, I’ve seen them bag up the cups and other garbage, but they don’t take it out. They have bags full of garbage in the corner on their side of the room and our rooms not big so it’s starting to creep towards our closet almost in the way of it. As for the bathroom they leave hair everywhere and I know it’s theirs and not mine because it’s their little rubber bands with the hair. Now like I said I am also at fault for the the bathroom being messy but I try to keep it somewhat clean by taking out the garbage and have cleaned the shower drain but they don’t even try to clean up a bit. I don’t know how they don’t get embarrassed when they have a friend over or even just with me being here. I get embarrassed having 2 cans on my desk and a few dirty forks or spoons for a few days because I’m too tired to wash them yet. Otherwise they’re a good roommate it’s just they never clean. I should also say they had a single room last year so it definitely feels like part of the reason since they would be used to not sharing a space but I want to have friends over and I’m embarrassed for my roommate. I don’t really know how to tell them to take their garbage out without sounding like a bitch and I already accepted I’m gonna be cleaning our bathroom alone.",
