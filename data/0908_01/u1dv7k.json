  "concern": "Hey, so I'm going to CSUS and taking the ALEKs Math test very soon and I'm very worried I wont do well because this math goes very far back and there's lots of things I've forgotten. I've taken all the possible math courses at my high school- all the way up to Calculus AB and BC (but I didn't pass the AP test so I have to take calculus in college) and I'm currently in AP Stats. I'm just worried that if I bomb this test they're going to put me in a super low math class. \n\nIn all the math classes I've taken I've gotten A's so... would they still put me in a low math class if I bomb the test even though my transcript shows that I've aced all the higher math classes I've taken? \n\nI would really appreciate any help/responses because this has been stressing me out a lot. Also, maybe this isn't the correct subreddit to post this question in, so I apologize if that's the case. But, I couldn't find a better place and this still applies to college and applications.",
