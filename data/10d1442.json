  "concern": "I don’t wanna just get a degree and that’s it. I’m wasting my time. I feel like college is good for people who wanna use it as a tool after they already know where they’re headed. It’s not the answer and people should stop pushing so much for it. I wanna hear someone’s opposing point of view cause I really don’t give two shits about it but maybe it’s cause I really need more life experience bfr I actually get to college and start to feel good about what I’m doing. I wanna work on other aspects of my life first. I just wanna have fun and gain experience. They’re so many options and I hate to feel limited to just going to college. I’m trying to have someone oppose this.",
