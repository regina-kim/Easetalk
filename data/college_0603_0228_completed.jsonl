I finally booked a great flight that is very cheap, but my University just announced the Commencement ceremony was changed from the 20th to the 25th, and my flight is on the 23rd. Now I have to decide if i'm going to move my trip and everyone pays an extra $200+ so I can walk, or just skip the Commencement all together. This university was my last choice, but the scholarship money was good so I went there and I always regretted it. I made one really close friend, but that's about it. I honestly never grew a connection to this school or the community; I was very close to the school therapist after the passing of my brother, but the therapist no longer works at my university. For a long time I did not even want to walk at graduation, but I was going to walk anyways. Now I am stuck and I don't know what to do. Everyone I talk to makes me feel bad for wanting to go on this trip instead of trying to reschedule it to walk. I guess most people have a good college experience and think its important to, but not walking does not take away from the fact that I am still graduating and this trip is to celebrate my graduation.

The only people I have gotten close to are professors, and I often have meetings to chat and I even have a research job with one of them. Also to preface, I in no way shape or form think I am better than anybody, but I feel that from my junior to senior year I have become more confident because of all of the things I have learned in my upper level environmental classes. All my life I’ve been the girl to keep my head down and do my work and get good grades, but since last fall it was like the flip of a switch, and I all of a sudden started feeling confident enough to participate in ~some~ classes. Right now I am in a sustainability class with a professor I have taken every semester and I usually participate in class maybe once a week, and earlier this week I had a presentation and I feel like I see how much I’ve grown comfortable with speaking. I am also in a capstone class and the overarching theme of the class happens to be something I have a lot of background knowledge in from research and other classes. Every class we have a discussion but when we break into groups no one talks to me and I just participate when we reconvene and my professor asks the questions to the class. On one hand I don’t care what people think since I don’t have any friends anyways but for some reason it crosses my mind and I do get self conscious if I am just that annoying girl in class.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hi there!

As you continue to reflect on your career path, it might be helpful to consider the many researchoriented fields within psychology, such as clinical psychology or social psychology, that allow for both interpersonal work and scientific inquiry. Have you looked into any of these areas?\nclient: I've looked into fields like clinical psychology and social psychology to some extent, as they seem to offer a mix of interpersonal elements and scientific research that could address my uncertainties. However, I'm still weighing whether these align with my broader career aspirations, which is why I'm continuing to seek advice from mentors and advisors.\ntherapist: It's great that you're exploring various fields within psychology that could potentially align with your interests and aspirations. Seeking advice from mentors and advisors is a wise move, as they can provide valuable insights and guidance based on their experience and expertise. In the meantime, it might be beneficial to reflect on your personal strengths and values, as these can also help guide your decisionmaking process. What are some of your strengths that could be assets in a career that combines psychology and science?\nclient: I've always been strong in communication and empathy, which could help in building relationships and understanding human behavior in a psychologyscience hybrid career. Additionally, my analytical skills from coursework allow me to approach scientific problems methodically, potentially aiding in research or practical applications.","completed":true,"turns":16}

I started taking an Anatomy and Physiology class which is required for all pre-meds. This class is notoriously known to be very hard and time consuming. I had made a friend in the class, who seemed very nice, but she started showing her true colors during exam times. She is also pre-med set on being a physician. Her tests are scheduled a day after mine and she gets 5 hours on the one hour exam because she has reported her anxiety as a disability and has accommodations  (she later revealed she lied to her doctor about being anxious and just wanted extra time, and she also heard when taking these tests which are proctored, the proctors don’t really notice cheating or turn a blind eye). So after I study for the exam and barely pass, she asks me for the questions on the exam to help her cheat because she was busy hanging out with her boyfriend and didn’t have time to study. I stalled and said that’s bad and it’s the fair since the class is curved. Then the second exam comes around and she tells me how she cheats on all her exams and even has her boyfriend take her exams for her. I have since blocked her because she keeps me for the exam questions. But she found me on Instagram and is trying to be friendly with me again. It’s just very disappointing that someone like this wants to pursue a career in the medical field when education and being honest is so important. What should I do? Should I report her?

I really am desperately seeking any sort of advice or reaffirmation that im not completely screwed and that i can still make it through college despite this distracting setback.

The academics are pretty good but it can be hard to get support sometimes especially having a learning disability. I’m also from the Midwest so I’m very far from home and I miss my family.

Plus I don’t have a car so I have to hope there’s a bus because it’s dangerous to walk there and half an hour each way. \nMy dorm is also a shithole. No matter how many times I Lysol and vacuum, there’s a stench that’s ingrained in the carpet. The rooms are so small and have a tiny window which looks like a prison cell. Everything is super outdated and they don’t ever clean the rooms. \nAs for social life, it’s weird here. You can’t just go to frat parties you have to have a ticket and pay. Which is annoying because I joined a sorority partially to get tickets and to make friends but it’s cliquey and we aren’t very involved in the community or on campus. There’s other parties here but they’re super hard to get into. I do like the student bands that put on concerts. There’s also not a lot of school spirit which sucks because there’s not a good sense of community. \nI like my friends and the clubs and classes and campus is pretty but there’s just so many issues.

Yes, I'd like to talk about some of the difficulties I'm experiencing at school.\ntherapist: Feeling homesick and overwhelmed can be really tough, especially when you're away from your familiar surroundings. It's great that you're reaching out to talk about the difficulties you're facing at school. What specifically has been challenging for you?\nclient: I've been struggling with the distance from my family, which amplifies my homesickness, and the lack of adequate support for my learning needs. These issues have made it hard to feel settled and connected here at school.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of emotions and challenges all at once. Being far from family and not having the support you need can make it really hard to feel grounded. Have you tried reaching out to any student services or resources on campus that might be able to help with your learning needs?\nclient: Yes, I've reached out to the campus therapists and some academic support services for my learning needs. While it's provided some help, I still feel quite overwhelmed by the overall challenges I'm facing here.\ntherapist: It's great that you've already taken steps to seek out help, even if it hasn't completely alleviated your feelings of overwhelm. Adjusting to a new environment can be really difficult, especially when you're dealing with multiple challenges at once. Have you considered reaching out to other students or joining any clubs or groups on campus that might help you feel more connected and supported?\nclient: Yes, I've already joined a sorority and some clubs to connect with others, but it hasn't fully helped me feel supported. Despite having friends and participating in activities, the overall sense of community here still feels lacking.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're really trying to find a sense of community and belonging at school, but it's not quite meeting your needs. That can be really frustrating, especially when you're already feeling homesick and overwhelmed. Have you considered talking to some of your sorority sisters or club members about how you're feeling? Sometimes just sharing your struggles with others who are going through similar things can be really helpful.\nclient: I've thought about opening up to my sorority sisters and club members, but I haven't done so yet because I'm concerned it might not lead to the support I need. Despite having friends, I still feel isolated and unsure if sharing would truly help me feel more connected.\ntherapist: It's understandable to feel hesitant about opening up, especially when you're already feeling vulnerable. At the same time, keeping your struggles to yourself can also contribute to feelings of isolation. Perhaps we can explore some ways to test the waters and gauge how receptive your friends might be to hearing about your struggles?\nclient: That's a good idea to explore ways to test the waters with my friends, as I'm curious if it could help ease my isolation. However, I'm still feeling hesitant because my past experiences have left me unsure about whether sharing will truly reduce my overall sense of overwhelm.\ntherapist: Your hesitation is completely valid, especially given your past experiences. It's important to honor your feelings while also considering potential benefits. Maybe we can brainstorm some lowrisk ways for you to open up, so you can get a sense of how your friends might respond without feeling too vulnerable?\nclient: That's a helpful suggestionI'd be open to brainstorming some lowrisk ways to share with my friends. However, I'm still feeling quite hesitant because my overall sense of isolation and overwhelm makes it hard to trust that it will lead to real support.\ntherapist: It sounds like your past experiences have left you feeling guarded and unsure about opening up to others. It's understandable that you want to protect yourself, but it's also important to remember that isolation can perpetuate feelings of overwhelm. Perhaps we can start by identifying one or two close friends who you feel might be receptive and understanding, and think about small ways to share your feelings with them?\nclient: That's a reasonable approach I could try identifying one or two close friends in my sorority who I think might be receptive. However, I'm still feeling hesitant about sharing due to my ongoing sense of isolation and overwhelm, which makes it hard to trust that it will truly help.\ntherapist: It's okay to feel hesitant, and it's important to honor your feelings. At the same time, it might be helpful to reframe the situation instead of expecting your friends to solve your problems or eliminate your overwhelm, consider the possibility that simply sharing your struggles could provide a sense of relief and connection. What do you think?\nclient: That makes senseI can see how reframing sharing as just seeking relief rather than full solutions might make it less intimidating. However, I'm still feeling hesitant because my ongoing sense of isolation and overwhelm makes it hard to believe it will truly ease my feelings of disconnection.\ntherapist: Your feelings of hesitation are valid, but its also important to consider that small steps can lead to bigger changes. Perhaps you could start by sharing a small piece of your struggles with one friend, and see how it feels? Even if it doesnt solve everything, it might help you feel a bit less alone.\nclient: That could be a manageable first step to try sharing a little with one friend.

{"id":"106itcf","timestamp":1673136000000,"category":"academic","concern":"I’m a freshman and at the beginning of my first semester, I got extremely sick for about a month and was testing negative for every covid test I took. I only felt well enough to go to class on some days but there were others where I couldn’t even get out of bed. My mom knew I was sick but there’s not much she could do because I go to school extremely far away from her. I didn’t tell her I wasn’t going to class on some days because she would’ve wanted me to go anyway. I ended up having to withdraw from one of my classes because I got too far behind and will be retaking it this following semester. I was left with only 3 classes. Two of my professors were extremely understanding of my illness and I was still getting my work done, so I was able to still end up doing well in those classes. \n\nIn my German class, my professor was extremely rude and did not answer a single one of my emails about me missing class. When I was able to return to class in person and explained, she didn’t really care. I struggled with my work a bit in the beginning, but was able to eventually start earning A’s on my tests and assignments with the professor even telling me I’ve made fantastic progress and that I was doing great. This professor never input a single grade into Canvas throughout the semester, and when I would ask her about my grade, she would just shrug and say she doesn’t know but she’ll check. When I would follow up, she’d say the same thing. This repeated for the entire semester. The class ended and I had no idea what my grade was, so I anxiously waited over winter break. My other two professors had inputed my grades, so I was only waiting on that one. \n\nGrades were due January 3rd and my final grade was posted on the 6th. She gave me an F, which I did not at all expect. This dropped my GPA below a 2.0 and puts me at risk of being put on academic probation. I’ve already contacted my advisor about appealing and will be calling the financial aid office on Monday, but I don’t know how to tell my mom without it sounding like i’m deflecting blame. She pays for all of my schooling and expenses, so I really don’t know what to do. She told me if I ever got an F she’d pull me out of school, but I genuinely don’t believe it was my fault in this situation.

I'm worried this could impact my academic standing and future opportunities.\ntherapist: That sounds like a really tough situation, especially with the added pressure of family expectations. It's understandable that you're feeling anxious. Have you considered reaching out to your professor to discuss the issue?\nclient: I've already tried reaching out to my professor during the semester, but it didn't lead to any resolution, which adds to my anxiety. I'm hesitant to try again because I'm worried it might not change the outcome and could worsen my stress about family expectations.\ntherapist: It can be frustrating when attempts to address a problem don't yield the desired results. It's natural to feel hesitant about trying again, especially when there's so much at stake. It sounds like your family's expectations are a significant source of stress. Have you thought about discussing your concerns with a trusted family member or friend?\nclient: I've thought about talking to a trusted friend, but I'm hesitant because I'm worried it might lead to more stress about my family's high expectations. I'm not sure if discussing it would help without first resolving the academic issues myself.\ntherapist: It's clear that you're feeling caught between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, you're dealing with the stress of unresolved academic issues, and on the other, you're worried about the potential fallout from your family's expectations. It's a lot to handle. It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck, unsure of how to move forward. Is that accurate?\nclient: Yes, that feels accurateI'm definitely feeling stuck between handling these academic challenges and the weight of my family's expectations. It's making it hard for me to figure out my next steps without escalating my anxiety.\ntherapist: It can be incredibly overwhelming to feel like you're facing a problem from multiple angles, especially when it's impacting your mental health. It's important to remember that you're not alone in this. Many people experience similar struggles, and there are resources available to help. Have you considered seeking support from your school's counseling services? They may be able to offer guidance and strategies to help you manage your anxiety and navigate the academic challenges you're facing.\nclient: Yes, I've already sought support from my school's counseling services to help manage my anxiety and navigate these academic challenges. It's been reassuring to have that resource, as it allows me to address my feelings of being stuck without immediately escalating the stress from family expectations.\ntherapist: It's great that you've already taken the initiative to seek support from your school's counseling services. That's a really positive step in managing your anxiety and navigating these academic challenges. It sounds like you're trying to find a balance between addressing your feelings of being stuck and minimizing the stress from your family's expectations. How have the counseling services been helping you so far?\nclient: The counseling services have been helping me by providing strategies to manage my anxiety and offering a supportive space to process my feelings. This has allowed me to gain some clarity on handling academic pressures without immediately involving my family, which eases my overall stress.\ntherapist: It's wonderful to hear that counseling services have been providing you with valuable support and strategies to manage your anxiety. Having a safe space to process your feelings and gain clarity can be incredibly helpful in navigating challenging situations. It sounds like this has been especially beneficial in helping you handle academic pressures without adding to the stress from your family's expectations.

Have you considered setting some small, achievable goals for yourself to help maintain your progress and reduce the risk of feeling overwhelmed by family expectations?\nclient: Yes, I've considered setting small, achievable goals like focusing on daily routines to manage my anxiety and tackle academic tasks step by step. However, I'm still worried that these goals might not fully shield me from the pressure of family expectations, making it challenging to maintain my progress.\ntherapist: It's great that you're setting small, achievable goals to manage your anxiety and tackle academic tasks. These goals can provide a sense of structure and accomplishment, even in the face of ongoing challenges.

That's why it's crucial to continue seeking support and practicing selfcare to help manage your anxiety and maintain your progress. Have you identified any selfcare activities that help you feel more grounded and centered when you're feeling overwhelmed?\nclient: Yes, I've identified selfcare activities like going for walks and practicing deep breathing exercises, which help me feel more grounded when anxiety builds.

Have you considered reaching out to professionals in fields that interest you, or even seeking guidance from your academic advisors, to gain a better understanding of potential career paths and how your passions might fit in?\nclient: Yes, I've considered reaching out to professionals in fields like history or the arts, as well as my academic advisors, to explore how my interests might fit into potential career paths. However, I'm still grappling with whether this would truly alleviate the regret I feel about my current academic direction.\ntherapist: It seems that, despite your efforts to explore alternative paths, you're still struggling with feelings of regret and uncertainty. Perhaps it would be helpful to reframe the situation instead of focusing on the regret, could you view this as an opportunity for growth and selfdiscovery?\nclient: Yes, I can see how reframing my situation as an opportunity for growth might help me move forward, rather than dwelling on the regret. However, I'm still trying to reconcile this with my underlying dissatisfaction about not pursuing subjects like history from the start.\ntherapist: It's clear that you're committed to finding a path that aligns with your passions, even as you navigate the challenges of regret and uncertainty. As you continue to explore your options, remember that it's okay to take your time and seek support from others who can offer guidance and perspective. Have you considered connecting with a mentor or counselor who can help you process your feelings and make an informed decision?\nclient: Yes, I've considered connecting with a mentor or counselor to help process my feelings and guide my decisions. However, I'm still working through whether that external perspective will fully ease the regret I have about not pursuing my true interests from the beginning.\ntherapist: It's important to acknowledge that seeking external support may not entirely eliminate your feelings of regret. However, a mentor or counselor can help you gain clarity and explore ways to move forward while still honoring your passions. Would you be open to taking that step and connecting with someone who can offer guidance and support?\nclient: Yes, I'm open to taking that step and connecting with a mentor or counselor for guidance and support. However, I'm still trying to reconcile this with my underlying feelings of regret about not pursuing my true interests from the start.\ntherapist: It's great that you're open to seeking guidance and support. Remember, the process of reconciling your feelings of regret may take time. As you work with a mentor or counselor, focus on finding ways to incorporate your passions into your future plans, even if it means taking a different path than you originally envisioned.\nclient: I appreciate your advice on incorporating my passions into future plans, and I'll make an effort to focus on that moving forward. However, I'm still reconciling with the regret that my original academic choices didn't align with my true interests.","completed":true,"turns":22}

Rather than studying for hours on end, I will break the studying sessions in thirty-minute blocks. That way, if I need a break, I can stop, and if I do not need a break, then I can continue working.\n\n2.       I was hesitant to reach out to my professors last semester, however this semester and the upcoming semester, I will reach out and contact my professor if I am confused or need additional help on the assignments or materials.\n\n3.       XXX’s Learning Lab is a very helpful tool, so I will meet up with a tutor for each class at least once a week to help clarify and review materials that I still do not understand even after contacting the professor for help.\n\n4.       I have also created a weekly schedule planner broken into thirty-minute increments that considers every task I complete.

How are you feeling today? I'm here to listen and support you in any way I can. What's on your mind? \nclient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and uncertain about some decisions in my life right now. I'm mostly thinking about my academic path and how to make choices that feel right for me.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're at a crossroads, and it's understandable that you might be feeling overwhelmed. Making big decisions about your future can be daunting. Can you tell me more about the choices you're facing?\nclient: I'm currently deciding between sticking with my university program or transferring to a community college for personal reasons. I'm worried that this choice might not align well with my major and could affect my future opportunities.\ntherapist: It's natural to feel worried about the potential consequences of your decision. You want to make sure that you're setting yourself up for success in your future career. Have you talked to any advisors or mentors about your options and how they might impact your major and future opportunities?\nclient: I've mainly discussed my concerns with you, the therapist, but I haven't reached out to academic advisors or mentors yet. I'm anxious that exploring different options might complicate my academic journey and future prospects.\ntherapist: Your anxiety is valid, and it's important to consider all the potential outcomes of your choices. However, reaching out to academic advisors or mentors can provide you with valuable insights and perspectives that you may not have considered. Have you thought about the potential benefits of exploring different options, such as gaining new experiences or skills that could enhance your future opportunities?\nclient: I've thought about how exploring different options could provide new experiences and skills that might strengthen my career prospects, but I'm still worried that it could complicate my academic path and future opportunities. It's hard for me to see the positives when I'm focused on the potential downsides right now.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you're having a hard time seeing the positives when you're feeling overwhelmed and anxious about the potential downsides. It might be helpful to take a step back and reframe your thinking. Instead of focusing solely on the potential complications, try to consider the potential benefits of exploring different options. For example, you might gain valuable life experience, develop new skills, or even discover a new passion that you wouldn't have otherwise.\nclient: I appreciate your suggestion to reframe my thinking and focus on potential benefits like gaining new experiences or skills, but it's still challenging for me to outweigh those against my fears about complicating my academic path. I'm trying to open up to the idea that exploring options could lead to personal growth and better alignment with my longterm goals.\ntherapist: It's great that you're trying to open up to the idea that exploring options could lead to personal growth and better alignment with your longterm goals. Remember, it's okay to feel uncertain and anxious about big decisions. You don't have to have all the answers right now. Taking small steps to explore your options, such as talking to advisors or mentors, can help you gain clarity and make an informed decision.\nclient: I appreciate your encouragement to take small steps like talking to advisors, as it's helping me feel a bit more empowered in my decisionmaking process. However, I'm still struggling with the anxiety that exploring these options might disrupt my academic path and limit my future opportunities.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you're feeling anxious about the potential disruption to your academic path. However, it's important to remember that taking risks and exploring new options can often lead to unexpected opportunities and growth. It's also worth considering that staying on the same path out of fear could lead to regrets down the road. Have you thought about what might happen if you don't explore these options?\nclient: Yes, I've thought about what might happen if I don't explore these options, and I'm concerned that I could end up feeling stuck or regretful if my current path doesn't align with my personal needs. However, it's still hard for me to fully let go of the anxiety that not exploring could mean missing out on growth while potentially avoiding complications.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're caught between the fear of missing out on growth and the fear of potential complications. That's a tough spot to be in. One thing that might help is to think about your values and priorities. What's most important to you in the long run? Is it stability and predictability, or is it personal growth and exploration?\nclient: In the long run, personal growth and exploration feel most important to me, as I want to ensure my choices align with my personal needs and lead to a more fulfilling path. However, I also highly value stability and predictability, which makes me anxious about how any changes might complicate my academic and future opportunities.\ntherapist: It's clear that both personal growth and stability are important to you, which can make decisionmaking challenging. Have you considered that sometimes, growth and stability can go handinhand? For example, exploring new options now could lead to a more stable and fulfilling future.\nclient: I've considered that pursuing growth through exploring options could potentially lead to greater stability in the long run, but I'm still anxious about how it might disrupt my current academic path and affect my future career prospects. It's tough to balance these ideas when I'm worried about making the wrong choice for my major.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're really struggling with the fear of making a wrong choice for your major. Maybe it would help to reframe this decision as an opportunity to gain clarity about what truly aligns with your values and goals. Is there a way to gather more information about your options, like talking to advisors or peers who have been through similar experiences?\nclient: I've thought about gathering more information by talking to academic advisors and peers who've experienced similar situations, as that could provide helpful insights. However, I'm still anxious that this process might highlight complications in my academic path and impact my future opportunities.\ntherapist: It's natural to feel anxious about the potential complications, but remember, the purpose of gathering more information is to empower you to make an informed decision. By talking to advisors and peers, you'll be able to weigh the pros and cons more accurately, which could ultimately lead to a choice that better aligns with your values and goals.\nclient: I understand that gathering more information from advisors and peers could help me weigh the pros and cons effectively, but I'm still anxious that it might reveal complications affecting my academic path and future career prospects. It's reassuring to think this could lead to a betteraligned choice, yet balancing that with my fears remains challenging.\ntherapist: Given your anxiety about potential complications, it might be helpful to start by identifying what your biggest concerns are. For example, are you worried about losing credits, falling behind, or missing out on specific opportunities? By pinpointing your concerns, you can then work with advisors and peers to address them and develop a plan that minimizes the impact on your academic path and future prospects.\nclient: My biggest concerns include the possibility of losing credits or falling behind in my academic progress, as well as potentially missing out on opportunities that could affect my future career path. It's challenging to address these fears because I'm worried they might confirm the complications I anticipate, making it harder to move forward confidently.\ntherapist: Given these concerns, it's crucial to seek guidance from academic advisors who can help assess the impact of transferring on your specific situation. They can provide insights into credit transfer policies and potential alternative pathways that might alleviate your worries about falling behind or missing out on opportunities. Have you considered scheduling a meeting with an advisor soon?\nclient: Yes, I've considered scheduling a meeting with an advisor soon, as I know it could provide helpful guidance on my options. However, I'm still anxious that it might reveal complications that could disrupt my academic progress and future opportunities.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you're feeling anxious, but remember that avoiding potential complications won't make them disappear. By meeting with an advisor, you'll be taking a proactive step towards addressing your concerns and finding solutions. It's better to know what you're dealing with and develop a plan, rather than letting fear and uncertainty hold you back.\nclient: I appreciate your encouragement to take proactive steps like meeting with an advisor, as it could help me address my concerns more effectively.

Remember, growth often involves facing challenges and uncertainties. By exploring your options and preparing for potential complications, you're taking steps towards creating a more fulfilling future for yourself.\nclient: I appreciate your reminder that growth often comes from facing challenges and uncertainties, and I'm trying to commit to exploring my options for a more fulfilling future.

Whats on your mind today? Im here to listen and help you explore your thoughts.\nclient: I'm feeling anxious about starting inperson classes this week, which is making it hard for me to sleep at night. As an introvert, I'm also worried about adjusting to new social situations in this unfamiliar environment.\ntherapist: It sounds like the thought of starting inperson classes is causing a lot of anxiety for you, especially with regards to adjusting to new social situations. It's totally normal to feel anxious about changes and unfamiliar environments, especially if you're an introvert.\nclient: Yeah, that's spot onit's tough adjusting to inperson classes and new faces as an introvert. I'm hoping we can explore some simple strategies to help me feel more at ease in this new environment.\ntherapist: Absolutely! Let's start by thinking about what aspects of this new environment make you feel most anxious. Is it the idea of meeting new people, navigating a new campus, or something else entirely?\nclient: I feel most anxious about meeting new people and the social interactions that come with inperson classes, as well as adjusting to this unfamiliar living situation on my own. Navigating the new campus adds to that unease, making it harder for me to relax and sleep at night.\ntherapist: It sounds like social interactions and adjusting to living on your own are at the heart of your anxiety. It's understandable that this combination of factors would make it hard to relax and sleep. Let's focus on these areas and explore ways to help you feel more at ease in this new environment. On a scale of 0 to 10, how confident do you feel about meeting new people and adjusting to living on your own?\nclient: I'd rate my confidence in meeting new people as about a 2 out of 10, since my introverted nature makes social interactions feel overwhelming right now. For adjusting to living on my own, I'd say it's around a 3 out of 10, as the unfamiliar environment is adding to my anxiety and disrupting my sleep.\ntherapist: It's clear that you're feeling quite low in confidence about these aspects of your new environment. Let's start by focusing on your confidence in meeting new people. You mentioned that your introverted nature makes social interactions overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels overwhelming? Is it the thought of starting conversations, maintaining eye contact, or something else?\nclient: What specifically feels overwhelming is the idea of starting conversations with new people, as it heightens my fear of judgment and makes me feel exposed. Maintaining eye contact also adds to that discomfort, amplifying my overall anxiety in social settings.\ntherapist: It sounds like starting conversations and maintaining eye contact are major sources of anxiety for you in social situations. It's important to remember that many people, introverted or not, experience similar feelings. It's natural to worry about being judged, but often these fears are greater in our minds than in reality. What are some ways you've coped with these feelings in the past?\nclient: In the past, I've coped with these feelings by relying on online interactions, like messaging or virtual chats, to avoid the pressure of facetoface conversations. I've also made an effort to prepare mentally in advance, such as rehearsing simple greetings, to reduce my anxiety in social situations.\ntherapist: It's great that you've found ways to cope in the past, like relying on online interactions and preparing mentally. These strategies can be helpful in easing anxiety. However, it's also important to challenge yourself to step out of your comfort zone in order to grow and develop new skills. How open are you to trying some new strategies for managing anxiety in facetoface conversations?\nclient: I'm fairly open to trying new strategies for managing anxiety in facetoface conversations, as I'm motivated to make this transition smoother. However, I'll need them to feel manageable and aligned with my introverted tendencies to avoid overwhelming myself further.\ntherapist: That's a great mindset to have!

I'd like to talk about some worries regarding my future career path.\ntherapist: Uncertainty about your education and future career can be a lot to carry. What are some of the specific worries you've been having?\nclient: I've been worried about whether my degree will be seen as credible and valuable for future job opportunities. Additionally, I'm concerned that the type of institution I attend might influence how potential employers perceive my education.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're really concerned about the impact your educational choices will have on your future career prospects. You're not alone in worrying about thisit's a common concern. Have you done any research or talked to anyone in your field about these worries?\nclient: Yes, I've done some online research to understand degree perceptions and their impact on careers. I've also begun discussing these worries with professionals to gain more perspective on how my educational choices might affect future opportunities.\ntherapist: That's great that you're being proactive in seeking out information and perspectives. It can be helpful to remember that there are many factors that contribute to career success, not just the degree or institution. What are some other qualities or skills you possess that might also contribute to your future success?\nclient: I possess strong problemsolving skills and practical experience from internships, which I believe will help me stand out in the job market despite my educational uncertainties. Additionally, I'm highly adaptable and committed to continuous learning, qualities that I hope will contribute positively to my career prospects.\ntherapist: It's wonderful that you recognize and appreciate the valuable qualities and skills you possess. Problemsolving, practical experience, adaptability, and a commitment to learning are all fantastic assets in any career. Given that, what do you think might be the biggest hurdle you'll face when applying for jobs?\nclient: I think the biggest hurdle I'll face when applying for jobs is the potential perception of my educational background by employers, which might overshadow my other qualifications. Despite this, I'm focusing on how my skills and experiences can demonstrate my capabilities effectively.\ntherapist: That's a smart approach, focusing on your strengths and how they translate to job performance. To help with this, have you considered creating a portfolio or resume that showcases your skills and experiences in a way that emphasizes their value to potential employers?\nclient: Yes, I've considered creating a portfolio and resume that highlight my skills and experiences to counterbalance any potential doubts about my educational background. I'm actively working on ensuring that these materials effectively demonstrate my capabilities and commitment, which I hope will make a strong impression on employers.\ntherapist: That sounds like a great plan! Remember, a wellcrafted portfolio and resume can go a long way in demonstrating your value to potential employers, regardless of any concerns about your educational background. As you continue to develop these materials, keep in mind that confidence in your abilities and a positive attitude can also make a big difference during the job application process.\nclient: I appreciate your encouragement about building a strong portfolio and maintaining a positive attitude, as it helps me feel more empowered in my job search. Still, I sometimes worry that perceptions of my educational path might affect how employers view my qualifications, even with my other strengths.\ntherapist: It's understandable that these worries persist, but remember that many successful people have followed nontraditional educational paths. Your skills, experiences, and attitude can speak for themselves. While some employers might focus on education, others will see the value you bring to the table.\nclient: Thank you for reminding me that nontraditional paths can still lead to success it's reassuring to hear that my skills might outweigh educational concerns. Even so, I sometimes worry that potential employers' perceptions of my background could influence their decisions despite my other strengths.\ntherapist: It's true that some employers might have biases, but remember that you can't control their perceptions. Instead, focus on what you can control presenting yourself and your skills in the best possible light. And remember, there are many employers out there, so if one doesn't see your value, another will.\nclient: I appreciate your advice on focusing on what I can control, like presenting my skills effectively, as it helps me stay proactive. Still, I sometimes worry that certain employers' biases about my educational background could impact their decisions, despite my efforts to highlight my strengths.\ntherapist: Your worries are valid, but don't forget that resilience and persistence are key. Keep putting yourself out there, highlighting your strengths, and networking with people in your field. You might face some rejections, but with each application and interview, you'll gain experience and confidence.\nclient: I appreciate your emphasis on resilience and persistence in my job search, as it motivates me to keep applying and networking despite my worries. Even with that approach, I sometimes fear that employers' biases toward certain educational backgrounds might still play a role in their decisions.\ntherapist: It's important to acknowledge that biases exist, but don't let that discourage you.

Remember, you're more than just your educational background you're a skilled, adaptable, and committed individual with a lot to offer.\nclient: I appreciate your encouragement to advocate for my unique strengths and remember my overall value, as it helps me stay motivated during my job search. Even so, I sometimes worry that employers' biases toward certain educational backgrounds might still influence their perceptions of my qualifications.\ntherapist: It's natural to have these concerns, but try to reframe your thinking. Instead of focusing on what might hold you back, concentrate on what sets you apart. Your adaptability, problemsolving skills, and commitment to learning are all qualities that many employers value. Believe in yourself, and let that confidence shine through in your applications and interviews.\nclient: I appreciate your advice on reframing my thoughts to focus on my strengths like adaptability and problemsolving, as it encourages me to build more confidence.

For a reason probably driven by Hollywood movies, I had the feeling that everyone would be cool with being friends with each other and would randomly come knocking on your door asking to hang out. I thought my roommates would become my friends, but when I moved in they didn't really want anything to do with me and our interactions solely consisted of \"hi\" and \"bye.\" Which is fine as roommates don't have to be friends.\n\nBy the end of the first month, it seemed like everyone already made their friend groups. I was getting worried by then, but people reassured me that I'll eventually find my people. Third year was basically the same as second year. I would go to outings but nobody wanted to be friends outside of the meetings. I would go to meetings, go to class, and then come back to my dorm to study. I never went out because I had no one to go with. \n\nSenior year was the year that I finally made one friend, who is my roommate. We aren't that close but that is fine.

It's great that you're looking for ways to cope and move forward. Can you tell me more about what specifically has been disappointing about your social experiences so far?\nclient: I've been disappointed by the lack of meaningful friendships despite my attempts to engage in social activities and events. This isolation has left me feeling unchanged and disconnected from the vibrant college experience I anticipated.\ntherapist: It's totally understandable that you're feeling let down and isolated, especially when you've been actively trying to make meaningful connections. It's tough when reality doesn't match our expectations. Have there been any social activities or events that you've enjoyed, even if they haven't led to the friendships you're looking for?\nclient: I've found some club meetings interesting because of the topics discussed, like sciencerelated events, but they haven't translated into the meaningful friendships I was seeking. Overall, these experiences have highlighted my ongoing sense of isolation, making it harder to feel connected in the college environment.\ntherapist: It's great that you've been able to find some enjoyment in certain club meetings, but I can see how it's frustrating that they haven't led to the deeper connections you're craving. It sounds like you're really longing for those meaningful friendships that can make college feel like a more vibrant and connected experience. Do you feel like there might be any other avenues or approaches you haven't tried yet to find those connections?\nclient: I've thought about trying online communities or study groups outside my major, but I'm hesitant because my previous efforts haven't led to the meaningful connections I crave. This makes it challenging to muster the energy to pursue new approaches, as I still feel that underlying sense of isolation.\ntherapist: It's understandable that your past experiences have left you feeling hesitant and low on energy. At the same time, it's important to remember that every new opportunity is a chance to find the meaningful connections you desire. Have you considered reaching out to a classmate or acquaintance who shares similar interests, or perhaps joining a smaller, more intimate group where it might be easier to form deeper bonds?\nclient: I've considered reaching out to classmates with similar interests, like those in sciencerelated study groups, but my past attempts have made me wary of potential disappointment. Joining a smaller group sounds appealing in theory, yet I'm still struggling with the energy to try due to my ongoing feelings of isolation.\ntherapist: Your hesitation is completely understandable, especially given your past experiences. It's important to honor those feelings while also recognizing that each new interaction holds the potential for connection. Perhaps we can explore ways to help you find the energy and motivation to keep trying, despite the challenges you've faced. Would you be open to discussing some selfcare strategies or mindset shifts that might help you feel more empowered to pursue new opportunities?\nclient: Yes, I'm open to discussing selfcare strategies and mindset shifts. I believe they could help me build the motivation to overcome my ongoing feelings of isolation and try new ways to connect.\ntherapist: Great! Let's start by acknowledging that it's okay to feel discouraged after experiencing disappointment in your social endeavors. It's a natural response, but it's also important to remember that each new situation is unique and has the potential for positive outcomes. One selfcare strategy you might try is to reframe your mindset from I've failed in the past to I'm learning from my experiences and growing as a person. This can help shift your perspective and empower you to keep trying.\nclient: I appreciate the suggestion to reframe my mindset as learning from experiences it feels like a helpful step toward personal growth. I'm willing to try this approach to build more motivation and reduce my sense of isolation in seeking connections.\ntherapist: That's wonderful to hear! Another selfcare strategy you might find helpful is to set small, achievable goals for yourself when it comes to social interactions. Instead of aiming to make a best friend overnight, focus on smaller steps like initiating a conversation with someone new or attending a social event for a short amount of time. Celebrate each small success as a step in the right direction.\nclient: I appreciate the idea of setting small, achievable goals for social interactions, as it feels more manageable after my past disappointments. I'm willing to try initiating conversations or attending events briefly, hoping it will help ease my ongoing sense of isolation and build more meaningful connections over time.\ntherapist: That's the spirit!

Remember, it's okay if things don't work out perfectly at firstthe key is to keep experimenting and adjusting until you find what works best for you. Have you considered reaching out to your professors or academic advisors for additional support or resources? They might have some helpful suggestions based on your specific situation.\nclient: I've thought about reaching out to my professors or academic advisors for support, but I haven't done it yet because I'm worried it might add more to my already overwhelming schedule. Still, I know getting their advice could help me manage my classes and work without risking further burnout.\ntherapist: It's natural to feel hesitant about adding more to your already busy schedule. But remember, your professors and advisors are there to support you, and they might have valuable insights or resources that can actually help you manage your workload more effectively. Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to make that initial outreach less overwhelming, like sending a brief email or setting up a short meeting during office hours.\nclient: I've been hesitant to reach out to professors or advisors because it feels like one more thing on my plate, but I'm open to brainstorming simple ways like sending a quick email to make it less daunting. That could help me manage my workload without adding to the stress I'm already feeling from juggling work and classes.\ntherapist: It's great that you're open to exploring ways to make reaching out to your professors or advisors feel less overwhelming. Here are a few ideas to get started\n\n Draft a brief email template that you can customize for each professor or advisor, explaining your situation and asking for their advice or resources.\n Set aside a small amount of time each week, like 30 minutes, to send out those emails or schedule short meetings during office hours.\n Remember, you don't have to tackle everything at onceeven just sending one email or scheduling one meeting can be a step in the right direction.\nclient: I've appreciate the email template idea, as it seems like a simple way to start reaching out without overwhelming myself further. Still, I'm concerned that even a little extra time for meetings might add to my packed schedule, but I know it could ultimately help me avoid burnout by getting better support for balancing work and classes.\ntherapist: That's a valid concern, and it's important to balance your time carefully. One strategy that might help is to prioritize the meetings that you think will be most helpful, and try to schedule them during times when you're less likely to have conflicts with work or classes. You could also consider asking if your professors or advisors are open to meeting virtually or over the phone, which could save you time and make it easier to fit into your schedule.\nclient: I've considered prioritizing and scheduling meetings for the most helpful professors, which could make outreach more manageable. However, I'm worried that even virtual options might add unexpected stress to my already tight schedule of work and classes.\ntherapist: You're doing a great job considering all the potential challenges. One thing to remember is that reaching out for support is an investment in your longterm success and wellbeing. While it might add some stress in the short term, it can ultimately help you find a more sustainable balance between work and school. And remember, you don't have to do everything at onceyou can start small and build from there.\nclient: I appreciate the reminder that starting small can lead to better longterm balance, and I'm willing to try sending just one email to begin with. Even so, I'm concerned that any added commitments might heighten my stress from juggling work and classes.","completed":true,"turns":22}

Now, move up to your calves, tensing and relaxing the muscles there. Continue this process, moving up your body, tensing and relaxing each muscle group. Take your time, and remember to breathe deeply as you go.\nclient: I just completed the progressive muscle relaxation exercise, and it helped me feel a bit more relaxed in my body, even though the underlying anxiety from this uncertainty is still present.

I was outstanding in some classes, mediocre in some, and near-failing in one or two.  When I was close to failing grades, my parents sat me down and made me decide: get myself together and finish college without near-failing grades happening again or drop out and get a job. I chose to grit my teeth and finish up because I didn't want college debt and nothing to show for it.\n\nFast forward and I finally got my degree. I wanted to get out of graduation real quick. I grabbed my paper, got my transcripts, and moved on to life. A year later, I enlisted in the Army and haven't looked back since. No, I didn't commission and become an officer. I enlisted.\n\nI'm writing this post to reflect on college five years after obtaining my degree. I've just finished paying off all my debt, and it's only struck me now how little I cared about those four years. I barely remember the faces and names of my former peers or professors, I didn't make a single friend, and I certainly don't remember anything from what I learned. In hindsight, my college life was so indifferent.\n\nDon't get me wrong; my degree has given me certain privileges and respect and I aim to take advantage of what I have. I'm actually at a point in life where I'm ready to willingly take the next step and get my master's degree. Still, I acknowledge that at the time I was an undergraduate, I wasn't truly ready.\n\nFor those who are done with higher education, what do you remember about your time?","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello!

{"id":"10noor4","timestamp":1674864000000,"category":"emotional","concern":"So about a couple weeks back right around the time my spring semester of college started. I finally decided to set up my student email to see what kind of messages I got that could be important. Looking through my mail, I got this one that said honor society on it. I clicked on the email that turned out to be an honor society acceptance letter. At first I was overjoyed and showed my parents who were also proud of me. I then started to set up to join this honor society program to be met with a membership menu. I was kinda puzzled having to pay for a membership when my good grades is what got me noticed in the first place. I asked my dad about it and he said that if I had to pay for a membership then I should just do it. Now I sat there in my desk chair for about 10 minutes wondering if I should seriously spend 65 dollars on a semi annual membership when I don’t even have a job yet. But then I just thought whatever and bit the bullet and sent my 65 dollars through my debit card. \n\nThen about 3 days later my sister calls me while I’m chilling playing video games at home. She asks how college is going since she’s in the same college I am. I tell her it’s going good to which she brings up honor society. I tell her it’s cool nothing seems off so far. And that’s when she tells me that honor society is a whole scam. I say there just in silence and embarrassment. She explained to me that she got an email for students to not respond to an email from honor society. I told her that I never got an email about it to which she says that I should get a new card and figure out how to solve this problem. I agreed with her and soon hung up my phone. Running to my laptop, turning it on, and scrolling through my emails I never saw a warning to never respond to an email from honor society. \n\nMy dumbass really thought I’ve seen all the scams on the internet. But it turns out I really haven’t seen nothing yet. Now it’s been a few weeks since then and I wonder from time to time about what I should do now. Should I try to get a refund and cancel my membership because it’s obviously useless to me now. And yeah 65 dollars is a major stupidity tax and I can afford to part with it but I still feel stupid and annoyed that I let something like this happen to me. So now I’m here after searching up homie society on google. Is there anything I can do to get my money back? Or am I just screwed?

How are you feeling today? Is there anything on your mind that youd like to talk about?\nclient: I'm feeling a bit anxious about some academic matters that have been weighing on me lately. Yes, I'd like to discuss a concern related to my university coursework.\ntherapist: That sounds like a lot to carry around. Would you be comfortable sharing more about these academic matters that are causing you anxiety?\nclient: I'm comfortable sharing a bit more about this, as it's been causing me some stress. It's related to uncertainties in my coursework, particularly around how to handle academic integrity in my assignments.\ntherapist: Academic integrity can be a tricky topic, and it's understandable that you're feeling anxious about it. It sounds like you want to make sure you're doing things right. Can you tell me a bit more about the specific concerns you have?\nclient: I'm feeling uncertain about whether I need to cite basic facts I already know in my assignments, as I'm worried it might be seen as not upholding academic integrity. It's specifically about distinguishing between personal knowledge and required sources in my coursework.\ntherapist: That's a valid concern, and it's great that you're being proactive about it. Understanding the distinction between common knowledge and information that needs to be cited can be confusing. It might help to think about it this way if the information is widely known and accepted, like a historical fact or a scientific principle, it's likely considered common knowledge. But if it's something that might be debated or contested, or if it's specific to a particular field or discipline, it's probably best to cite a source.\nclient: That helps clarify things a bit, but I'm still feeling anxious about whether facts I already know might need citations to maintain academic integrity. Could you give me some guidance on how to doublecheck if something counts as common knowledge?\ntherapist: Certainly, I can offer some guidance on this! One way to doublecheck if something counts as common knowledge is to ask yourself if the information can be found in multiple reliable sources. If it can, and if it's generally accepted as fact, then it's likely common knowledge and doesn't require a citation.\n\nAnother approach is to consult your course materials or syllabus. Sometimes instructors will provide guidelines or examples of what they consider common knowledge within the context of the course.\n\nIf you're still unsure, it never hurts to err on the side of caution and include a citation. That way, you can feel confident that you're upholding academic integrity and avoiding any potential issues.\nclient: I appreciate your guidance on checking for common knowledge it gives me a clearer path to follow in my coursework. Even with that, I'm still feeling a bit anxious about ensuring I'm maintaining academic integrity with facts I already know.\ntherapist: It's natural to feel anxious about this, as it's an important aspect of your academic work. Along with the guidance I provided, you might find it helpful to keep a record of your sources as you conduct your research. That way, if you're ever unsure about whether a particular piece of information needs a citation, you can easily refer back to your notes and doublecheck.\n\nAdditionally, remember that your university likely has resources to support students with questions about academic integrity. You might consider reaching out to a librarian, a writing center, or your course instructor for further clarification or assistance.\n\nRemember that you're not alone in navigating these concerns, and it's great that you're taking the initiative to ensure you're doing things properly.\nclient: I appreciate your suggestion to use university resources like the writing centerit's reassuring to know I'm not alone in this. Even with that, I still feel a bit anxious about applying these guidelines to facts I already know in my assignments.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you might still feel anxious, even after receiving guidance and exploring resources. Here are a few additional suggestions that might help ease your anxiety\n\n1. Consider discussing your concerns with a trusted peer or classmate. They may be able to share their own experiences or provide a different perspective that could be helpful.\n2. Practice applying the guidelines we discussed to a few examples of facts you already know. This can help you become more familiar with the process and build your confidence in making decisions about citations.\n3. Take breaks and engage in selfcare activities to manage your anxiety. Remember that your wellbeing is important, and taking time for yourself can help you approach your academic work with a clearer and more relaxed mindset.\n\nRemember that it's okay to ask for help and guidance as you navigate these concerns. You're taking the right steps by seeking information and support, and that's something to be proud of.\nclient: I appreciate your additional suggestionsthey're helpful for managing my anxiety and building confidence. Still, I'm feeling a bit uneasy about making sure I handle facts I already know properly in my assignments.\ntherapist: It's natural to feel some lingering uneasiness, even after discussing strategies and resources. Remember that you can always revisit this topic and continue seeking guidance as needed. For now, let's focus on acknowledging your efforts and the progress you've made so far.\n\nYou've taken important steps to address your concerns about academic integrity, and you've shown a commitment to doing things properly. Give yourself credit for being proactive and seeking support. This demonstrates your dedication to your academic work and your personal growth.\n\nAs you move forward, continue to be mindful of the guidelines we discussed, and don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it. Remember that making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process, and it's important to be kind to yourself along the way.\n\nKeep in mind that you're not alone in navigating these challenges, and there are people and resources available to support you. Take things one step at a time, and trust in your ability to handle any obstacles that may arise.\nclient: I appreciate your encouragement and the reminder to be kind to myselfit's helping me feel a bit more supported in this process. Still, I'm finding it challenging to fully shake off the anxiety about handling facts I already know in my assignments without secondguessing myself.\ntherapist: It's completely normal to experience lingering anxiety, even after discussing strategies and receiving support. It might be helpful to explore the underlying emotions and thoughts contributing to your anxiety. Here are a few questions to help guide your selfreflection\n\n1. What specific thoughts or beliefs are fueling your anxiety about handling facts you already know? Are there any patterns or themes you notice?\n2. Are there any past experiences or situations that might be influencing your current concerns?\n3. How might your anxiety be related to your personal values or goals? For example, is it connected to a desire to excel academically or a fear of failure?\n\nBy understanding the root of your anxiety, you can develop more targeted strategies to manage it. Remember that anxiety is a normal response to uncertainty and stress, and it's important to acknowledge and address these emotions with compassion and selfcare.\nclient: I think the main thoughts fueling my anxiety are doubts about whether my prior knowledge counts as reliable enough for academic work without sources, leading me to worry about unintentionally crossing integrity lines. Past experiences with strict grading in high school might be influencing this, and it's tied to my goal of maintaining high academic standards and avoiding any risk of failure.\ntherapist: It sounds like your anxiety is rooted in a desire to meet high academic standards and avoid potential mistakes. Given this understanding, here are some additional suggestions that might help alleviate your concerns\n\n1. Consider discussing your specific doubts about prior knowledge with a librarian or writing center staff member. They can provide more tailored guidance and help you assess the reliability of your knowledge within the context of academic work.\n2. Reflect on the differences between your current academic environment and your past experiences in high school. Recognize that grading and expectations may vary, and it's important to adapt to the specific requirements of your university.\n3. Remind yourself that making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process, and it doesn't define your overall academic performance or worth. Focus on your growth and the efforts you're making to maintain integrity in your work.\n\nAs you continue to navigate these challenges, be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. Remember that seeking support and taking steps to address your concerns demonstrates your commitment to your academic journey.\nclient: Thank you for the suggestionsthey provide practical steps to address my doubts about academic integrity.

It's a tough spot to be in. When you do manage to get started on assignments, do you find it easier to keep going, or does the struggle continue?\nclient: When I manage to get started on assignments, it often feels a bit easier to keep going at first, but the struggle with maintaining focus quickly resurfaces. This ongoing cycle of distraction heightens my anxiety about completing tasks effectively.\ntherapist: It sounds like a real tugofwar between focus and distraction, and that constant battle is keeping your anxiety levels high. Have you tried any specific strategies to help you stay on task and avoid getting sidetracked?\nclient: I've tried using timers and breaking tasks into smaller chunks to stay on track, but they don't always help me maintain focus for long. This inconsistency in my strategies just adds to my anxiety about managing assignments effectively.\ntherapist: It's clear that you're trying different strategies to help with focus and procrastination, but it can be frustrating when they don't always work. It's almost like there's a constant tugofwar between your efforts to stay on track and the distractions that keep pulling you away. What's your gut telling you about why these strategies might not be working consistently?\nclient: My gut tells me that underlying anxiety about not meeting expectations is probably undermining these strategies, making it hard to stick with them consistently. This cycle of doubt and distraction keeps pulling me back into procrastination, even when I'm trying to stay on track.\ntherapist: So, it sounds like there's a deeper layer of anxiety at play hereanxiety about not meeting expectationsthat might be the root cause of your procrastination. This anxiety is almost like a saboteur, making it hard for you to trust in your strategies and stick with them. It's a tricky situation to be in. Do you think this anxiety about expectations is coming from within yourself, or from external sources?\nclient: I believe this anxiety about expectations is mostly coming from within myself, driven by my own high standards and fears of falling short. It's making it even tougher to break free from my procrastination habits and maintain consistent focus on my work.\ntherapist: It takes a lot of courage to recognize that this anxiety is coming from within, and that it's tied to your own high standards. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to perform perfectly, and that fear of falling short is really holding you back. Have you ever tried giving yourself a little more grace and compassion when it comes to your work?\nclient: I've tried to be more compassionate with myself during assignments, but it's challenging because my high standards often make me feel guilty for any delays. This selfpressure tends to reinforce my procrastination cycle, making it harder to stay focused.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're caught in a really difficult cycle, where your high standards are leading to selfpressure, which in turn is reinforcing your procrastination and making it harder to focus. It's a tough spot to be in, for sure. I'm curious, though have you ever tried reframing your thoughts about these delays? Instead of seeing them as failures, what if you saw them as opportunities for learning and growth?\nclient: I've occasionally tried reframing delays as opportunities for learning, but it's tough because my high standards quickly turn them into sources of guilt. This inner conflict just reinforces my anxiety and makes it harder to maintain focus on my work.\ntherapist: It sounds like this inner conflict between your high standards and the reality of delays is really at the heart of your anxiety and procrastination. It's almost like your standards are acting as a doubleedged sword, pushing you to do well but also causing you to feel guilty and anxious when things don't go perfectly. Have you ever considered adjusting your standards a bit, to give yourself some breathing room and reduce the pressure you're feeling?\nclient: I've considered adjusting my standards to ease the pressure, but I'm concerned that doing so might lead to subpar results, which only intensifies my anxiety. This internal conflict makes it harder for me to break out of my procrastination habits and stay focused on my work.\ntherapist: It's clear that you're caught in a difficult dilemma, where adjusting your standards feels like a risk, but maintaining them is causing you a lot of stress and anxiety. It sounds like you're really stuck between a rock and a hard place. Have you ever tried to explore what's behind these high standards? What are you afraid will happen if you don't meet them?\nclient: I've given some thought to what's behind my high standards, but I haven't explored it in depth yet. I'm afraid that if I don't meet them, I'll end up failing my classes or not living up to my own expectations, which heightens my anxiety and makes it harder to stay focused on my work.\ntherapist: It's really brave of you to start exploring what's behind these high standards. It sounds like there's a deep fear of failure and not meeting your own expectations driving them. But have you ever considered that holding yourself to such high standards might actually be making it harder for you to succeed, by causing so much stress and anxiety?\nclient: Yes, I've considered that my high standards could be backfiring by adding to my stress and making it harder to succeed. This awareness only intensifies my anxiety, as it feels like I'm caught in a cycle that's reinforcing my procrastination habits.\ntherapist: You're in a really tricky situation, where your high standards are both driving you forward and holding you back at the same time. It's almost like you're trapped in a maze, with your anxiety and procrastination acting as the walls keeping you from finding your way out. It sounds like a really difficult and frustrating place to be. Have you ever tried taking a step back and looking at the big picture of your goals and values?\nclient: I've occasionally tried stepping back to consider my overall goals and values, but it's challenging because my anxiety about falling short often overshadows that perspective. This struggle makes it harder to break free from my procrastination and maintain focus on my work.\ntherapist: It seems like your anxiety about not meeting expectations is really clouding your ability to see the bigger picture and make progress towards your goals. It's like a fog that keeps rolling in and obscuring your vision, no matter how hard you try to see through it. Have you ever tried any relaxation techniques or selfcare practices to help clear your mind and reduce your anxiety?\nclient: I've tried relaxation techniques like deep breathing and selfcare practices such as short walks, but they often don't sustain my focus for long. This inconsistency just heightens my anxiety about meeting my own high standards and breaking my procrastination habits.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're really trying to find ways to manage your anxiety and stay focused, but the inconsistency in your relaxation techniques and selfcare practices is making it difficult. It's almost like you're trying to build a house on shifting sand, and it's frustrating when the foundation keeps moving. Have you considered seeking support from a therapist or counselor to help you develop more consistent strategies and work through your anxiety?\nclient: I've considered seeking support from a therapist, and in fact, I've started talking to one about this. I'm hoping it will help me better manage my anxiety and break free from my procrastination habits.\ntherapist: That's great to hear! Working with a therapist can be incredibly helpful in developing consistent strategies to manage anxiety and break the cycle of procrastination. It's like having a guide to help you navigate the maze and find your way out. What are some specific goals you're hoping to achieve through therapy?\nclient: I'm hoping to achieve better management of my anxiety so I can consistently overcome my procrastination habits and maintain focus on my work. Additionally, I'd like to learn how to balance my high standards with more selfcompassion to break the cycle of stress and delay.\ntherapist: That's a really thoughtful and comprehensive set of goals, and it sounds like you're on the right track by seeking therapy. Achieving better anxiety management, breaking procrastination habits, and finding a balance between high standards and selfcompassion are all great things to work towards. Do you have any ideas for specific strategies you'd like to try out with your therapist?\nclient: I've been considering strategies like cognitive behavioral techniques to reframe my negative thoughts about delays, and incorporating more consistent mindfulness exercises to enhance my focus. I'm also open to building a structured routine that balances my high standards with selfcompassion to reduce anxiety and break the procrastination cycle.\ntherapist: Those are fantastic ideas for strategies to explore with your therapist. Incorporating cognitive behavioral techniques, mindfulness exercises, and a balanced routine can all be incredibly helpful in managing anxiety and overcoming procrastination. It sounds like you're really taking ownership of your mental health and working towards positive change. Are there any other areas of your life that you think might benefit from therapy as well?\nclient: I've been thinking that my social life and daily routines could benefit from therapy, as my anxiety often spills over and affects my ability to engage fully with friends or maintain consistent selfcare. Exploring this might help me build better habits overall, reducing the cycle of procrastination and stress that impacts my studies.","completed":true,"turns":34}

Therefore it should be no surprise I wish to major in something related to humanities, but so far, I have yet to apply to college or go to work, and now I'm wondering, is it too late? I should mention that I have an older brother that would be willing to help me get a job in Germany, where of course I'd be paid in euros, a currency stronger than the zloty. Should I simply take a gap year and focus on work, developing skills and maybe making some connections, or should I lock in and apply to college, go to work for a bit and focus on my degree? And if so, what would be a good major for me? I'm obviously looking for something in humanities that would also have some creativity required, perhaps journalism?

Let's start with the gap year what are some potential benefits and drawbacks you see?\nclient: For a gap year, the benefits could include gaining practical work experience and building essential skills like networking, which might make me more prepared for future studies. On the downside, it could delay my education and career progression, potentially making it harder to get back on track if I lose momentum.\ntherapist: Given these pros and cons, it seems like your main concern is about losing momentum if you take a gap year. It's important to consider that many successful people have taken gap years and found them to be beneficial. Plus, the skills and experience you gain during a gap year could actually help you stay focused and motivated when you return to your studies.\nclient: That does reassure me somewhat about the potential benefits of a gap year, especially in building skills that could enhance my future studies in journalism. However, I'm still concerned that delaying college might disrupt my overall momentum and make it harder to commit longterm to my career path.\ntherapist: It's understandable to have lingering concerns. Let's now consider the pros and cons of starting college right away. What benefits and drawbacks do you see in this option?\nclient: For starting college right away, the benefits include getting a head start on my degree in journalism and building academic momentum to align more quickly with my career goals. On the downside, it might leave me feeling unprepared without prior work experience, potentially making it harder to balance studies with the practical skills I need for the field.\ntherapist: You've identified some key considerations for both options. It seems like your main worry with starting college immediately is the lack of prior work experience and practical skills. Have you thought about potential opportunities to gain those skills while in college, such as extracurricular activities, internships, or parttime jobs?\nclient: I've considered opportunities like internships and parttime jobs while in college, as they could help me build practical skills in journalism alongside my studies. However, I'm still worried that starting college without prior work experience might leave me feeling less prepared overall and could affect my longterm career momentum.\ntherapist: It's clear that you're taking your future seriously, which is commendable. Given your concerns about both options, perhaps we can reframe the decision by focusing on your longterm goals. What are your ultimate career aspirations in journalism, and how might each option help you achieve them?\nclient: My ultimate career aspiration in journalism is to become a skilled reporter or writer who can creatively tell compelling stories while securing stable job opportunities in media. A gap year might help by providing practical experience and networking skills to strengthen my application, while starting college immediately could offer the academic foundation needed to build momentum toward these goals without delay.\ntherapist: It sounds like both options have the potential to contribute to your longterm career goals in journalism, but in different ways. A gap year could provide you with practical experience and networking opportunities, while starting college right away would give you the academic foundation and momentum to pursue your career aspirations. Perhaps the decision ultimately comes down to your personal preference and comfort level with each option.\nclient: I appreciate that both a gap year and starting college could support my journalism goals differently, and I'm leaning towards gaining practical experience first to feel more prepared. However, I'm still grappling with my comfort level, as delaying college makes me worry about losing momentum in building a stable career path.\ntherapist: Your concerns are valid, and it's important to consider them carefully. One way to think about it is that a gap year isn't a delay in your career path, but rather an investment in your future success. By gaining practical experience and building essential skills, you'll be better equipped to make the most of your college education and achieve your longterm goals.\nclient: I appreciate your perspective that a gap year could be an investment in my future, as it might help me build the practical skills needed for journalism. Still, I'm concerned that any delay might affect my ability to maintain momentum toward establishing a stable career in the field.\ntherapist: Your concerns are valid, but remember that momentum isn't just about the speed at which you complete your education. It's also about the quality of your experiences and the skills you develop along the way. A gap year could actually enhance your momentum by providing you with a strong foundation of practical skills and work experience that will make you more competitive in the job market.\nclient: I appreciate your reassurance that a gap year could enhance my momentum through practical skills and experience, which aligns with my interest in journalism. However, I'm still worried that any delay might make it harder for me to stay committed to my longterm career goals.","completed":true,"turns":26}

Yes, there is something on my mind that I'd like to discuss, especially how to cope with feeling isolated from my closest people.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're dealing with some tough emotions surrounding your friendships. Feeling isolated from the people you're closest to can be really difficult. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been happening with your friends that's been causing you to feel this way?\nclient: I've been dealing with some unexpected changes in my friendships that have left me feeling more isolated lately. It's been tough adjusting to not having those close connections around as much as before.\ntherapist: It's understandable that unexpected changes in friendships can leave you feeling isolated. Adjusting to those changes can be challenging.

Is there something on your mind that you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen and offer support. \nclient: Yes, I've been thinking about my college path and the decisions I've made so far. I'm concerned about committing to a major and whether it's the right fit for me longterm.\ntherapist: That's a really important decision, and it's completely normal to have some uncertainty. It sounds like you're really reflecting on your future and what you want out of your college experience. Can you tell me more about what's making you question your current path?\nclient: I'm concerned that choosing a major might lock me into a path I'm not fully sure about, especially after the flexibility of starting at community college. This uncertainty is making me hesitant to move forward without exploring other possibilities.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you're feeling hesitant about committing to a major, especially when you're still exploring your options. It can be a big decision that impacts your future. But it's also important to remember that choosing a major doesn't necessarily lock you into a specific career path forever. Many people end up changing their career paths multiple times throughout their lives.\nclient: That's helpful to know that career paths can change, but I'm still anxious about committing to a major right now, as it feels like it might limit my options down the line. How can I explore alternatives without fully locking myself in?\ntherapist: You're right that choosing a major can feel limiting, but there are ways to explore alternatives without committing fully. Have you considered taking some elective courses in subjects that interest you, or pursuing a minor in a different field? This could give you a chance to explore different options without fully committing to a major right away.\nclient: Yes, I've considered taking elective courses in subjects that intrigue me, as it could help me dip my toes into other areas without a full commitment. However, I'm still worried that this might not fully alleviate my anxiety about potentially locking myself into a major that doesn't feel right longterm.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're really wrestling with this decision, and it's great that you're taking the time to think it through. I'm curious, what is it that's most important to you in a major? Is it the subject matter itself, or are you more concerned with the potential career opportunities that might come from it?\nclient: I'm most concerned with the potential career opportunities that come from a major, as I want to ensure it aligns with my longterm flexibility and interests. While the subject matter is important, my anxiety stems from not wanting to feel trapped in a path that might not suit me down the line.\ntherapist: It's completely valid to be concerned about future career opportunities and flexibility. Have you considered looking into majors that are more versatile and offer a wide range of career options? For example, majors like business, communications, or psychology can lead to many different career paths, which could give you more flexibility down the road.\nclient: I've considered exploring versatile majors like business or communications to keep my options open for various career paths. However, I'm still anxious that even these might feel restrictive if my interests evolve over time.\ntherapist: It's clear that you value flexibility and adaptability in your future career. Have you thought about exploring interdisciplinary majors, or even creating your own customized major? This could allow you to combine multiple interests and create a more personalized path that better aligns with your evolving goals.\nclient: I've thought about exploring interdisciplinary majors or creating a customized one to combine my interests and maintain some flexibility. Even so, I'm still anxious that this approach might not fully protect me from feeling locked into a path if my interests evolve over time.\ntherapist: It's clear that you're really committed to finding a path that feels flexible and adaptable to your evolving interests. I'm wondering, have you considered the possibility of pursuing a double major, or even a major and a minor? This could allow you to explore multiple interests and keep your options open.\nclient: I've considered pursuing a double major or combining it with a minor to explore multiple interests and maintain some flexibility in my options. Even so, I'm still anxious that this could end up feeling restrictive if my interests change significantly over time.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're caught in a bit of a cycle, where no matter what options you consider, you're still feeling anxious about potentially being locked into a path that doesn't align with your future interests. Have you thought about what might help you feel more confident and less anxious about making this decision?\nclient: I've thought about talking to career counselors or alumni to learn more about how others have navigated similar uncertainties, which might give me some reassurance. Even with that, I still feel anxious that any major I choose could limit my ability to adapt if my interests change over time.\ntherapist: It's great that you're thinking about seeking out advice from career counselors and alumni who have gone through similar experiences. That could certainly provide some valuable insights. One thing to remember is that it's impossible to predict exactly how your interests will evolve over time, but by choosing a major that aligns with your current interests and values, you'll be setting yourself up for success in the shortterm, while also gaining skills and knowledge that can be applied in a variety of contexts.\nclient: I appreciate the reminder that choosing a major based on my current interests could build useful skills, but I'm still anxious that it might feel restrictive if my evolving passions don't align with that path later on. How can I work on accepting this uncertainty while moving forward?\ntherapist: You're right that uncertainty is a part of life, and learning to accept and embrace it can be a valuable skill. One way to work on this is to reframe your thinking around the decision. Instead of viewing it as a final, irreversible choice, try to see it as one step in a lifelong journey of learning and exploration. Remember, even if your interests evolve, the skills and knowledge you gain from your major can be applied in many different contexts.\nclient: I appreciate the suggestion to reframe choosing a major as just one step in my journey, as it helps me see the bigger picture. Even so, I'm still anxious that this approach might not fully prevent me from feeling trapped if my interests evolve in unexpected ways.\ntherapist: It's clear that this uncertainty is causing you a lot of anxiety. Let's try to break this down a bit further. On a scale of 110, how anxious do you feel about this decision right now?\nclient: On a scale of 110, I'd say my anxiety about this decision is around an 8 right now. This level of anxiety reflects my ongoing concern that committing to a major might limit my ability to adapt to changing interests over time.\ntherapist: Given your anxiety is an 8, what small, manageable step can you take this week to explore your interests further? Could you research one interdisciplinary major, attend a career counseling session, or reach out to an alumnus for their perspective?\nclient: I could attend a career counseling session this week to gain more insights into flexible options and how others have navigated similar uncertainties. Even as I take this step, I'm still anxious that it might not completely safeguard against feeling locked into a path if my interests evolve over time.\ntherapist: That's a great step forward, and it's important to remember that uncertainty is a natural part of life. Even as you explore your options and gather more information, there will always be some degree of uncertainty. But by taking small steps and staying open to new possibilities, you'll be better equipped to navigate whatever the future holds.\nclient: I appreciate your encouragement about embracing uncertainty and taking small steps, as it helps me feel more prepared for the future.

{"id":"1271sv5","timestamp":1680134400000,"category":"academic","concern":"Ok, I am very confused and frustrated, and I don't know what to do here.\n\nSo, I am in a very interdisciplinary major (won't say what because it's a VERY small department and it will immediately doxx myself and this person) and we have an approved course list that comes out every semester that tells us what those courses \"count\" for in the major. There are some staples that never change and what requirements they fulfill, but the real reason this list is sent out is so we know how more niche classes (say, ones that are only offered in Fall or Spring, or only offered in even years, etc.) can be used to meet our major requirements. \n\nFor years, the list archives show CLASS 101 as fulfilling X, Y, and Z requirements. Now, I know the curriculum hasn't changed because I know the person teaching the class. Yes, it is the same professor. It is one of the \"staples\" I mentioned above. It's offered every semester, and the core requirements do not change. Now it's listed as only fulfilling X requirement for the major. The class, again, has not changed in any way. I have even confirmed with the prof that, outside of writing new test questions to make sure nobody cheats, the content covered will remain identical and they have no idea why it might suddenly be different. \n\nThis is also now true for CLASS 102, CLASS 103, CLASS 104, etc. In previous semesters, they have been consistently used to fulfill A, B, and C. Now they only fulfill A. \n\nWhat this means, essentially, is that I am going to have to stay another YEAR (I was supposed to graduate in Fall) to complete more classes to fulfill requirements that the classes I ALREADY TOOK should have covered, because now, suddenly, they don't fulfill those requirements anymore. Literally just because this one person said so. Or, worst case scenario, I will max out my units (I'm a senior and was a transfer so I'm already close to doing that) and not be allowed to finish at all since my uni won't let anyone enroll in Fall or Spring if they have over 132 units. All because my adviser has changed the requirements. \n\nI've tried to email the adviser about this change, and they said it should have always been listed this way and I'll just have to take these other classes to make up for the changes. Except, like, we went over a course plan together. TWICE. And these classes fulfilled those requirements *then*. It feels like this person just randomly pulled these new rules out of thin air at the last minute, and it's gonna tank me. \n\nI am one of only maybe 10 students in my sub-specialty, so this isn't something that screws over the *whole* department. But, like... I am still fully at risk of not getting a degree now because my adviser has shifted the goalposts at the last minute. It's been established for YEARS that these classes fulfill these distribution requirements for the major, and now suddenly I'm expected to just accept that a bunch of my credits won't count toward my degree anymore??? Also, what is stopping this major adviser from pulling this nonsense again if I do stay an extra year and they decide I can't be on the degree list because they've changed the requirements yet again??? \n\nWho can I talk to about this? I am (obviously) livid and I have the receipts. Unless my adviser can produce a darn good reason to suddenly change the major requirements with NO WARNING, or why these classes can't count for students who have already taken them, I feel like this is worth going higher up. I just don't know who \"higher up\" is. The department chair? The dean of the college? \n\nThanks.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome! How are you doing today?

Whats been on your mind lately? Anything youd like to talk about?\nclient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed and exhausted lately with all the academic pressures building up. I'd like to talk about how to manage this stress and make better decisions in these situations.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load of stress and exhaustion from the academic pressures. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed. I'm here to listen and help you explore ways to manage that stress and make decisions that work best for you.\nclient: I've been struggling with the constant pressure of deadlines and assignments, which is leaving me feeling drained and indecisive. I'm hoping we can discuss some practical strategies for prioritizing tasks and reducing this overwhelming exhaustion.\ntherapist: That constant pressure can definitely wear you down, both mentally and physically. It's great that you're looking for practical ways to prioritize tasks and reduce exhaustion. One approach we could explore is breaking larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Have you tried this before, or is this something new we could work on together?\nclient: I haven't really tried breaking larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps in a structured way before, as the constant pressure often leaves me too overwhelmed to think clearly. I'm definitely open to exploring this together, hoping it can help me reduce my exhaustion and make better decisions moving forward.\ntherapist: Breaking tasks into smaller chunks can be a gamechanger in managing stress and feeling more in control. Let's start with a simple exercise can you identify one big task that's causing you stress right now? We can work together to break it down into smaller steps.\nclient: One big task that's causing me stress right now is preparing for an upcoming presentation, which has me feeling overwhelmed with the time pressure and unfinished work. I'm hoping breaking it down into smaller steps will help me feel less exhausted and more capable of managing it.\ntherapist: Absolutely! Let's tackle that presentation together. The first step could be to brainstorm and organize your ideas. Have you already done some brainstorming, or would you like help getting started?\nclient: I haven't done much brainstorming yet because the time pressure has left me feeling too overwhelmed to start. I'd really appreciate your help in getting started, as it could help me feel more in control and less exhausted overall.\ntherapist: Alright, let's get those creative juices flowing!

I'd appreciate some guidance on how to approach this, hoping it will help me feel more in control and reduce my overall exhaustion.\ntherapist: therapist Of course! Here's a simple approach to categorizing your ideas\n\n1. Read through your list of ideas and look for common themes or topics.\n2. Create a separate list for each theme or topic you identify.\n3. Go through your original list of ideas and assign each idea to one of the theme lists you created.\n4. Once you've categorized your ideas, you can use these lists to create an outline for your presentation.\n\nDoes this approach make sense, or would you like me to clarify any of the steps?\nclient: Yes, this approach makes sense and seems straightforward for organizing my thoughts.

I'd appreciate some guidance on how to approach this, hoping it will help me feel more in control and lessen my overall exhaustion.\ntherapist: therapist No worries! Here's a stepbystep approach to filling in the details of your presentation\n\n1. Start with the introduction Write a brief overview of your presentation topic and what you'll be covering.\n2. Move on to the body For each section of your outline, add supporting information, examples, and anecdotes that help illustrate your main points.\n3. Use visual aids Consider adding diagrams, charts, or images to help convey your ideas more effectively.\n4. Conclude with a summary Wrap up your presentation with a summary of your main points and a call to action for your audience.\n\nRemember to take breaks and give yourself time to recharge throughout the process. Let me know if you have any questions or need further guidance.\nclient: This stepbystep approach for filling in the details seems helpful and manageable, even with the ongoing pressure I'm facing. I'm hoping it will allow me to work through the task more effectively and reduce my overall exhaustion as I proceed.\ntherapist: therapist It's great that you find this approach manageable, especially considering the pressure you're under. Remember to take breaks and practice selfcare throughout the process. Once you've filled in the details, the final step is to practice your presentation.

Rehearse out loud Practice delivering your presentation as if you were in front of an audience.\n2. Use a timer Time yourself to ensure your presentation fits within the allotted time frame.\n3. Record yourself Record your practice sessions and review them to identify areas for improvement.\n4.

So I have the same professor for both the Biology and its lab extension. For our first week’s assignment, the teacher gave us a list of 8 questions we had to answer about ourselves in a paragraph form of at least 200 words. I wrote my paragraph and posted it then checked the lab and she asked the same 8 questions and I didn’t really think much of it when I posted my same introduction to the lab class also since all my answers to these questions are the same no matter what. Well she graded one class and said “Submitting the same work in different classes is considered plagiarism, and is a serious academic offense.” \nSo I understand how “using the same work” could be considered plagiarism, but in an instance like this one where it’s just meant to be an introduction to get to know your classmates and for attendance verification purposes, is it really a serious academic offense or considered plagiarism if it’s my own writing and about me? It’s not like it was a 10 page paper or a normal homework assignment. \nI supposed it could be considered lazy to not reword it, but it could also be considered pretty lazy for the professor to use the same exact questions for the lab class as the other class if they are meant to be taken simultaneously.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hi there!

I'm hoping it can guide me toward resolving the situation calmly without adding to my anxiety.\ntherapist: Great! Let's start by thinking about the main points you want to get across to your professor. Maybe we could begin with a clear statement of your intentionsthat you weren't trying to plagiarize, but rather reuse your own work in related classes. How does that sound as a starting point?\nclient: That sounds like a good starting point I'd want to emphasize that I was simply reusing my own introduction for related classes without intending to deceive or plagiarize. It could help me feel more prepared and less anxious as I think about approaching the conversation.\ntherapist: It's great that we're making progress in preparing for this conversation. Another important point to consider is how you can show that you understand the seriousness of plagiarism and that you want to avoid any future misunderstandings. Do you think you could acknowledge your professor's concern about plagiarism and express your willingness to learn from this experience?\nclient: Yes, I think I could acknowledge my professor's concern about plagiarism and express my willingness to learn from this experience, as it would show my respect for academic integrity. This approach might help me feel more confident in handling the conversation without increasing my anxiety.\ntherapist: It's great that you're willing to take responsibility and learn from this situation. Remember that acknowledging your professor's concern and expressing your willingness to grow can go a long way in resolving this issue. When you're ready to have the conversation, take a deep breath, stay calm, and focus on communicating your points clearly and respectfully. You've got this!\nclient: I appreciate your encouragementit really helps me feel more grounded and ready to face this situation. I'm committed to staying calm and communicating respectfully as I work through this misunderstanding about my assignment.","completed":true,"turns":16}
{"id":"1bk1qmi","timestamp":1710979200000,"category":"academic","concern":"Hey guys, I am an accounting and finance double major, and I may have failed an accounting class that is only offered in the winter term (we use the quarter system).  This class is a prerequisite to every other upper-level accounting course.  Accounting majors need 225 quarter credits to be CPA eligible, making it a 5-year degree for a full-time student.  Failing this class will set me back an entire year, and I won't be able to make any progress toward my degree while I am waiting for the class to be available again a year from now.  Once I do retake the class and hopefully pass, there is a whole year's worth of classes after, which is the \"5th-year senior series\".  The other problem with staying an extra year is I can't financially support it.  I took out student loans, which will run out, and I can't afford to take out more.  \n\nI took 18 credits and had five finals during this finals week, something I thought I could handle.  It was my 4th final of the week and 2nd of the day; I didn't spend much time studying for it because I had been doing really well in the class and had borderline grades in my other classes, which I prioritized.  I had a B going into the final exam, but the midterm and final make up 85% of the class grade, so failing it tanked my grade to a C-, which is not passing.   \n\nI am contemplating changing my major to just finance due to having to wait a whole year to retake the class.  I would be able to graduate in the upcoming fall as I am just a couple of classes short of the finance degree requirement.  This is a tough decision because I have an internship lined up at a Big 4 accounting firm, and I don't want to lose that.  I also enjoy accounting and have done well in past accounting classes, it is something that I want as a career.  \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation, or have any suggestions of other possible options?

That can be really hard to deal with, and it's great that you're reaching out for support. Can you tell me more about what's been happening?\nclient: I've been feeling a lot of pressure from comparing my community college experience to the typical university social scene, which has worsened my selfesteem. It's made it tough to stay motivated with daily routines like studying and selfcare.\ntherapist: It's understandable that comparing your experience to others can be tough on your selfesteem. It's important to remember that everyone's journey is unique, and there's no one right way to do things. It's great that you're aware of how this is impacting your daily routines. Have you tried any strategies to manage these feelings?\nclient: I've tried exercising at the gym to boost my selfesteem, but it became too hard to maintain with my study schedule. Recently, I've been focusing more on my studies to improve my grades, which helps a bit with my overall motivation but leaves me feeling exhausted.\ntherapist: It's great that you've been taking steps to improve your selfesteem and motivation, even if it hasn't always been easy. Balancing school and selfcare can be a tough challenge, and it's totally normal to feel exhausted at times. How do you feel about trying to find a balance between studying and selfcare that works better for you?\nclient: I think finding a better balance between studying and selfcare sounds helpful, even if I'm worried about how to fit it in without falling behind. I'm open to trying new strategies, as long as they don't add more stress to my already busy routine.\ntherapist: It's really positive that you're open to trying new strategies. Maybe we can explore ways to incorporate selfcare into your routine without adding too much extra stress. For example, have you considered breaking selfcare activities into smaller, more manageable chunks throughout the day, rather than trying to fit in a full gym session?\nclient: I've considered breaking selfcare into smaller chunks, like short walks or quick stretches, but I haven't fully tried it yet due to my packed schedule. I'm open to exploring this approach if it could help ease my exhaustion and improve my overall selfesteem without overwhelming me.\ntherapist: Let's start by setting a realistic goal for this week. How about aiming to incorporate two short selfcare activities, like a 10minute walk or some stretches, into your daily routine? This way, we can test out this approach without adding too much extra stress. Does that sound doable?\nclient: Yes, that sounds doable for me, as short activities like a 10minute walk could fit into my routine without adding much stress. I'm hopeful it might help ease my exhaustion and give a small boost to my selfesteem.\ntherapist: Awesome, I'm glad that feels manageable. Remember, it's not about perfection, but about finding a balance that works for you. You've got this!

There's multiple dining halls that anyone can go to get food. I noticed the Chick-Fil-a is the only place I've been to that has a visible screen and will say \"that is $\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\". All the other places don't say anything, no screen, no receipt, only prices listed on drinks and on shelf items (not even online menu shows prices). Only when I ask is when I know what I am paying from my meal plan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just decided to get 8 piece chicken wings and a 20oz soda just now. Last time I got that was from another dining hall and I expected to pay about $14 ($2.90 for soda \\[that's listed on the cooler and same price as other halls\\] and about $10 for the wings). The cashier charged me $22.38! I was able to see the register at this one and noticed she charged me $4.30 for the soda and $16 for the wings (that where cold). I didn't say anything then but now I am annoyed and not sure what to do here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I could, I would never get the meal plan but if I am in a dorm, I am forced to have one by policy.

The problem is the internet always says to go to events and join clubs to meet new people, but I am unable to go since my brother always wants to leave campus right away.\n\nNo-one in my classes really want to talk to each other, and people get annoyed when I have asked if I can sit at the same table as them in public spaces as I need to use an outlet that is by the table. I don't get it at all. I love talking to people, had a bunch of friends in high school despite my social anxiety. I got along with just about anybody I have talked to pre college.

{"id":"107lmbj","timestamp":1673222400000,"category":"school_life","concern":"I’m looking for advice on how to make a decision on majors. I am currently taking full-time PSEO courses at a private college in Minnesota, in my Junior year of HS. I am covering my generals, but soon I am going to have to make a decision so I don't waste next year on random courses that might not benefit my future. This first semester of college has been amazing, and also really anxiety provoking when I consider how fast time is passing. I can't imagine how much greater my anxiety will be when I actually have to start paying for the classes I take. \n\nMy plan has always been to go to school for years on end and earn my VMD license. I do really enjoy working with animals and have fostered numerous cats and dogs. I even plan to get my school paid for by joining the military, the army has a vet school program. I get good grades and enjoy the biology and science classes I have taken, but recently I have been very anxious about my future. I'm beginning to question my motives. I feel like I haven't really explored other career options because it has just always been known that I will go into a veterinary career. I have heard my entire life,\n\n“you're an animal whisperer,” \n\n“you wouldn't do well working with actual humans,”\n\n“you can do anything you want in life,”\n\nfrom the adults that seem to know everything there is to learn. I feel like at this point, I can't change my career path because it is just socially accepted that this is it. I would be happy to be a Vet! I know there are many who struggle to see cruelty cases every day, and there is absolutely change needed to our animal healthcare system in the US. But there are so many other options to take with my schooling and my life. Do I really want to spend my 20’s in labs and classrooms? Do I want to lose my faith in humanity when I see animals abused again and again? Can I make more of a difference if I choose to do something else with my time but donate to organizations that already make a difference? I just have this lurking feeling that getting a different job might be more realistic for the life I want. I enjoy school, but I lack any kind of social life, and I don't want it to be this way forever. I feel like I’m missing something that seems to motivate everyone else. \n\nI enjoy the arts and have been active in the art scene in my city. I went to a Performing arts High School and loved the environment to uplift my community. But there isn’t enough money to support a mediocre vocalist in our current media craze. I so enjoy history and would love a job as a environmental historian, or maybe an environmental chemist. Anything to study the world around me, and appreciate the natural ways of the world, and how we are so insignificant but create such wide problems. What I wouldn't do to be an anthropologist, working towards uncovering the truth behind our human development. But these fields pay so little, in a scene so wide. \n\nHow did you decide what to do with your life? How did you decide what to major in? Is there a major that can satisfy the possibility of everything I could do? What if I get through my first veterinary med class just to puke at an incision site? Do I go for a lighter job, say, environmental preservation, with the possibility of never retiring? It's all some big scam, sure, but I have this feeling it matters so much. \n\nAnd then comes actually choosing the school to best serve my major! And does it really matter where you go? Do schools really vary so much under the same curriculum? Is it normal to be so worked up about this? I just can't help thinking this decision I make at such a young age might make me unhappy for the rest of my life. The potential for success is so great, and the likelihood of unhappiness also. Any advice is appreciated. Or maybe just thanks for reading my brain dump.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hi there! What's on your mind today?

{"id":"1dgag5w","timestamp":1718409600000,"category":"emotional","concern":"I graduated in December of 2023. It was one of the happiest days of my life. I was in a tough and rigorous program, where I had to meet numerous requirements, those of which were dependent on wether I would graduate or not. The stress of the uncompleted requirements hanging over my head constantly, not being able to sleep the night of my 7am-6pm clinicals, eating my emotions 24\/7, along with dealing with some toxic people in a class of 11; let’s just say, I couldn’t be happier to go home. To get out of there. To never look back. That, is exactly what I’ve done. Today, I sit here in bed, and I think about, specifically, the last year and a half, the peak of my educational program. To sum things up, it almost feels like a fever dream. Like it was never real. A part of me likes that. The other half of me is frightened by that. I often think there’s something wrong with me. To believe that all of that really happened. That I was in another city, away from my family, living on my own. Instead of studying to take my boards like others in my class have, I haven’t touched the material since. Every song I hear from that time period, every reminder, takes me back, to a dark place. A place that, when it’s bed time, I dream I must eventually go back to, in order to complete my doctorate; my soul wishes that things are different this time around. In my dreams, I am always trying to escape. Always being abandoned by my family. Yearning to be any place but there. I wonder, if I could’ve avoided engaging with a certain toxic person, that things would have been different. A “friend” who weighed me down just as much as my academic stress did. Someone who’s actions spoke louder than their words. Someone I was only of use to when it came to giving advice about her multiple situationships. I tried to run from her, but she wouldn’t let me. A narcissistic, master manipulator. I wish, that my parents could feel what I felt, in my time there. My siblings see it as the door to freedom, an escape from a beautiful garden, that is my household. I see it as one of the worse times of my life. To remember that Covid-19 was my escape from the most depressing time in my life, shocks me. Packing my stuff and leaving, to never look back, for the next year and a half. Despite my experience, on December 9th, I sat proudly in that chair, not giving a care at all. The most toxic person I’ve ever met in my life, was sitting next to me during my happy time; yet again, talking about someone else. I didn’t even care. I was so happy, to just be done with it all. To say goodbye, to never look back. To not have to hold onto a friendship with any of those people anymore, even though I wanted to, because they weren’t all toxic. The darkness of my past comes creeping back when I text them or engage with them. I am no longer in contact with her, because I stood my ground. I just pray and hope, that things will be different this time around. I wish I could complete my doctorate from home, without having to leave my safe place. I still wonder, why my brain chose to react the way it did, my emotions. Was it ever real?","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hi there, how are you feeling today?

I'd like to talk about ways to process those past experiences and move forward positively.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're having a tough day, with those old memories surfacing unexpectedly. It's good that you're reaching out to talk about ways to process them. Would you be comfortable sharing a bit more about these memories?\nclient: I'm not entirely comfortable sharing more details right now, as it still feels overwhelming. Instead, I'd like to focus on general strategies for coping with these resurfacing memories and building a sense of stability moving forward.\ntherapist: That's completely understandable, and it's important to respect your boundaries. We can certainly discuss some general strategies for coping with these memories without delving into specifics. One technique that might be helpful is grounding exercises, which can help bring you back to the present moment when feeling overwhelmed by memories. Have you tried any grounding techniques before?\nclient: No, I haven't tried grounding techniques before, as I've been focused on avoiding triggers from my past. I'm open to learning about them, hoping they can help me stay grounded and reduce the unease from those resurfacing memories.\ntherapist: Grounding techniques are a great way to help you feel more connected to the present moment, and can be especially helpful when you're feeling overwhelmed by memories or emotions. One simple technique you can try is the 5 Senses Exercise. This involves focusing on each of your five senses, one at a time, to help bring you back to the here and now. Would you like me to walk you through this exercise?\nclient: Yes, I'd like you to walk me through the 5 Senses Exercise, as I'm hoping it will help me manage the unease from those unexpected memories. I'm open to trying new techniques that can bring more stability to my daily life.\ntherapist: Alright, let's begin the 5 Senses Exercise. Start by finding a comfortable position, whether that's sitting or standing. Now, let's focus on your sense of sight. Look around and take in your surroundings. Notice the colors, shapes, and textures around you. What do you see?\nclient: I see the soft blue walls of my bedroom and the stack of books on my desk, with their varied colors and textures. It's helping me focus on the present and feel a bit more grounded already.\ntherapist: That's great to hear! Now, let's move on to your sense of hearing. Listen to the sounds around you, both near and far. Notice any background noises, like the hum of an air conditioner or the distant chatter of people outside. What do you hear?\nclient: I hear the quiet hum of the fan in my room and the distant birds chirping outside, which feels calming amidst the background noise. This is helping me stay focused on the present and reduce the unease from those resurfacing memories.\ntherapist: Excellent! Now let's focus on your sense of touch. Feel the sensations of your body in contact with whatever you're sitting or standing on. Notice the pressure, temperature, and texture of the surface beneath you. What do you feel?\nclient: I feel the soft fabric of my bedsheets against my skin and the firm support of the mattress beneath me, which has a slight coolness to it. This awareness of the textures and sensations is helping me stay anchored in the moment and reduce the lingering unease from those resurfacing memories.\ntherapist: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more grounded and present as we progress through this exercise. Let's continue by focusing on your sense of smell. Take a deep breath in through your nose, and notice any scents or aromas around you. What do you smell?\nclient: I smell the faint, fresh scent of laundry detergent from my clean bedsheets and a subtle hint of coffee from my morning cup nearby. This awareness of the scents is helping me feel more present and easing the unease from those unexpected memories.\ntherapist: It's amazing how tuning into your senses can help bring you back to the present moment and ease that unease. For the final part of this exercise, let's focus on your sense of taste. If you have anything nearby that you can safely taste, like a sip of water or a piece of gum, do so now. What do you taste?\nclient: I taste the cool, refreshing flavor of a sip of water I just took, with a slight mineral note from the glass. This awareness of the taste is helping me feel more present and further easing the unease from those resurfacing memories.\ntherapist: It sounds like you've done a fantastic job with the 5 Senses Exercise! By engaging each of your senses, you've successfully grounded yourself in the present moment, easing the unease from those unexpected memories. Remember, you can use this technique anytime you feel overwhelmed or need to refocus. Do you feel like this exercise is something you can incorporate into your daily routine?\nclient: Yes, I believe I can incorporate this exercise into my daily routine, as it's been helpful in managing those unexpected memories. It feels like a practical tool to build ongoing stability and keep me grounded in the present.\ntherapist: That's wonderful to hear! The 5 Senses Exercise is a great tool to have in your toolbox, and it's fantastic that you feel confident in using it to build ongoing stability. Remember, consistency is key, so try to practice this exercise regularly, even on days when you're feeling more grounded. This will help build the habit and make it easier to turn to when you need it most.\nclient: I appreciate the reminder about consistency I'll make a point to practice the 5 Senses Exercise daily to help maintain my sense of stability. It's reassuring to have this tool as I work through lingering unease from past experiences.","completed":true,"turns":22}

That's a lot of pressure to carry. Can you tell me more about why you're questioning the value of your educational choices?\nclient: I'm questioning the value of my educational choices because I've received conflicting advice that makes me doubt whether my qualifications will be recognized as I hoped.

A specialist in US education and job markets can offer valuable insights and guidance based on their expertise. They may also be able to provide resources and support to help you navigate your academic choices and their potential impact on your future. Do you have any concerns about reaching out to a counselor or advisor?\nclient: Yes, I have some concerns that the advice from a counselor might not fully resolve my uncertainties about how my academic choices align with future opportunities. I'm worried that even with their help, the conflicting information I've encountered could leave me still feeling unsure.\ntherapist: That's a valid concern, and it's important to remember that seeking advice from a counselor is just one step in the process of navigating your academic choices. It's possible that the counselor may not have all the answers, but they can certainly provide guidance and support as you work through your uncertainties. It might also be helpful to gather information from multiple sources, such as talking to other students or professionals in your field, to get a wellrounded perspective on your options.\nclient: I appreciate your suggestion to gather information from multiple sources, as I'm still dealing with ongoing uncertainties about my academic choices. I'm concerned that even with more perspectives, the conflicting advice might leave me feeling just as unsure about my future opportunities.\ntherapist: It's definitely a complex situation, and it's understandable that conflicting advice can make it difficult to feel confident in your decisions.

This post is just gonna be me venting\/asking for thoughts? \n\nI started college at 17 and now I am graduating with a Biology degree. I graduate in 2 months. College really has not been fun for me. I've struggled a lot with my grades, mental health, friends, financially, etc. I have not had a car throughout college. Most of my days have been spent on campus and not being able to go out. Most of the \"fun\" times I have had in college involved substance abuse. I had a friend group in my junior year and we would just get drunk and go to parties. I got assaulted twice at a party. After that, I distanced myself from the group and stopped going out. Now, its my second semester of my senior year. All of senior year, I have not had any friends and spent September-now alone. My best friend lives a few hours away and goes to another school and we talk everyday. However, I dont have anyone on campus to hang out with. I am looking forward to my life after college. I will be financially independent, have a car, an apartment and have the freedom I have been craving. I wont have to rely on my parents financially and can really be an adult. I already have a few companies ready to hire me. I just want it to be April so badly so I can graduate and move on to the next chapter of my life. I feel depressed when I have to go to class still and do assignments. I know I sound whiny and dumb. But I am so deeply burnt out from school and everything I've gone through. I am still passing all my classes and managing fine. But everyday feels the same and I just have urges to self destruct. I want to go back to substance abuse to cope with my feelings. But I know if I do that, my grades will suffer, and I dont want to fuck up when Im so close to graduating. I dont really feel excited about graduating and it doesnt feel real. I keep feeling like something will randomly happen that stops me from graduating. I wish I could just calm down and ride out these last 2 months and be happy about this huge accomplishment. My parents are so happy and proud of me. I dont understand whats wrong with me and why I cant just be happy for myself.

It's important to consider your wellbeing when making these decisions. It sounds like you've managed heavy loads before, which is a testament to your resilience.

This will help us get a better sense of how adding more courses might fit into the equation.\nclient: client Sure, I'm currently handling a full course load of about 21 credit hours, along with some extracurricular activities and personal responsibilities like parttime work and family time. I'm worried that adding another class might disrupt my current balance and strain my mental health, even though I've managed heavy loads in the past.\ntherapist: That's a lot on your plate already! With 21 credit hours, extracurriculars, work, and family time, it's understandable to be concerned about adding more. You mentioned that you've managed heavy loads beforewhat strategies did you use then to maintain your balance and mental health?\nclient: In the past, I relied on strong time management techniques, like prioritizing tasks and scheduling regular breaks to prevent burnout. I'm considering if those strategies would still hold up now, given my concerns about maintaining my mental health with an even heavier load.\ntherapist: It's great that you've already developed some effective time management techniques. While they might still be helpful, it's important to consider the potential impact on your mental health with an increased workload. Perhaps we can brainstorm some additional strategies that could help you manage the added stress, while also maintaining your current balance. Would you be open to exploring some ideas together?\nclient: Yes, I'm definitely open to exploring some ideas together to help me manage this potential increase in my workload. I'm hoping we can find strategies that prioritize my mental health and prevent any further imbalance in my daily routine.\ntherapist: therapist Let's start by discussing some potential strategies that could help you manage the increased workload while prioritizing your mental health\n\n1. Reassessing priorities Consider if there are any current commitments that you can scale back on or delegate to others, allowing you to free up some time and energy for the additional course.\n2. Implementing selfcare routines Make sure to schedule regular time for activities that help you relax and recharge, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with friends.\n3. Utilizing campus resources Look into academic support services, counseling, or study groups that can provide additional assistance and help you manage stress.\n4. Setting realistic expectations Be honest with yourself about what you can realistically achieve and be willing to adjust your goals if necessary.\n\nWhich of these strategies do you think might be the most helpful for you?\nclient: I think implementing selfcare routines and setting realistic expectations would be the most helpful strategies for me, as they directly support my mental health and help me avoid overcommitting. Reassessing priorities might also be useful to ensure I maintain a balanced routine amidst my academic demands.\ntherapist: therapist It's great to hear that you're prioritizing selfcare and setting realistic expectations. Here are some tips on how to effectively implement these strategies\n\n1. Selfcare routines\n\n Schedule selfcare activities in your calendar and treat them as nonnegotiable appointments.\n Experiment with different activities to find what works best for you, such as exercise, meditation, journaling, or spending time in nature.\n Make sure to get enough sleep, as it's crucial for maintaining mental health and cognitive function.\n\n2. Setting realistic expectations\n\n Break down your goals into smaller, more manageable tasks.\n Be kind to yourself and avoid negative selftalk if you don't meet your expectations.\n Regularly check in with yourself to see if your expectations are still realistic and adjust them if necessary.\n\nBy consistently implementing these strategies, you'll be better equipped to handle the increased workload while maintaining your mental health and overall balance.\nclient: I appreciate these tips on selfcare routines and setting realistic expectations, as they align with my goal of maintaining mental health amid my academic pressures. I'm eager to try incorporating them into my routine to ensure I don't overcommit and disrupt my overall balance.","completed":true,"turns":16}

Do you feel comfortable sharing a little bit more about the difficulties your loved one is facing?\nclient: I'm a bit hesitant to go into specifics, but my loved one is facing some instability in their housing situation, which has been quite unexpected. This has left me feeling uncertain about how to provide support while taking care of my own needs.\ntherapist: It's totally understandable to feel hesitant about sharing details, and that's okay. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, wanting to help your loved one with their housing situation while also making sure you're taking care of yourself. Have you thought about what kind of support you might be able to offer without overwhelming yourself?\nclient: I've thought about offering emotional support and maybe some practical advice, but I'm worried that getting too involved could affect my own studies and mental health. I'm trying to find a balance where I can help without taking on more than I can handle.\ntherapist: It's really important to find that balance, and it sounds like you're being thoughtful about your own limits. Have you considered talking with your loved one about your concerns, and maybe setting some boundaries around the kind of support you're able to offer?\nclient: I've considered talking to my loved one about my concerns, but I haven't brought it up yet because I'm still figuring out how to approach it without making things worse. As for setting boundaries, I'm thinking about it, but I'm worried that doing so might strain our relationship while I'm trying to support them.\ntherapist: It's natural to worry about how setting boundaries might affect your relationship, especially when you're trying to be supportive. But remember, setting boundaries isn't about cutting off support it's about finding a way to provide support that's sustainable for both of you. Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to bring up your concerns and set boundaries in a gentle, compassionate way?\nclient: That sounds like a helpful idea I'm open to brainstorming ways to discuss my concerns gently. I'm worried that approaching boundaries might feel challenging, but I want to ensure I can offer support without compromising my own wellbeing.\ntherapist: It's great that you're open to exploring ways to discuss your concerns gently. One thing that might help is to use I statements when bringing up your concerns, like I care about you and want to support you, but I'm feeling overwhelmed with my own responsibilities and I'm worried about taking on too much. This can help keep the focus on your own experience and feelings, rather than blaming or criticizing your loved one.\nclient: That sounds like a practical approachI'll try using I statements to express my feelings more clearly. I'm still a bit anxious about how to apply this without adding more strain to the situation, but I'm committed to prioritizing my own wellbeing as I offer support.\ntherapist: It's completely understandable to feel anxious about bringing up your concerns. Remember that setting boundaries is a form of selfcare, and it's important to honor your own needs in order to provide sustainable support. You could also consider offering specific, manageable ways you can help, like assisting with research or connecting them with resources, so that you can provide support without overcommitting yourself.\nclient: That sounds like a good strategy for offering help in a manageable way I'm considering ways to connect my loved one with resources like campus services without taking on too much myself. I'm still feeling a bit uneasy about it, but I'm committed to finding that balance to protect my own studies and wellbeing.\ntherapist: It's great that you're exploring ways to provide support without taking on too much yourself. Remember that it's okay to feel uneasy about setting boundaries, but ultimately, it's important for both you and your loved one. You could also consider offering emotional support by being a good listener and validating their feelings, which can be just as helpful as practical support.\nclient: I appreciate the suggestion of offering emotional support by being a good listener it seems like a way to help without overextending myself. However, I'm still feeling a bit uneasy about navigating this, as I want to ensure I'm maintaining my own emotional balance while providing that support.\ntherapist: Balancing emotional support for others with your own wellbeing is a delicate act, and it's normal to feel uneasy about it. Remember to check in with yourself regularly and prioritize selfcare activities that help you maintain your emotional balance, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with supportive friends. This way, you can continue to provide support without neglecting your own needs.\nclient: I appreciate the reminder to prioritize selfcare activities like exercise and meditation to maintain my emotional balance. I'm still feeling uneasy about balancing this support with my own needs, but I'm committed to checking in with myself regularly to ensure I don't neglect my wellbeing.","completed":true,"turns":20}

Can you tell me more about the volunteer commitment and what specifically has been causing your lack of motivation?\nclient: I appreciate you asking, but my volunteer commitment involves assisting with a project that requires a significant time investment, which has been challenging without any compensation. This lack of motivation stems from needing to prioritize financial stability, making it hard to continue without affecting my overall wellbeing.\ntherapist: It makes sense that volunteering without compensation can be difficult, especially when you need to prioritize your financial stability. It's important to take care of yourself and your wellbeing. How do you think you can handle the transition professionally while preserving positive connections?\nclient: I think I can handle the transition professionally by scheduling a respectful meeting with my supervisor to clearly explain my reasons and express gratitude for the opportunity. This way, I hope to preserve positive connections and possibly secure a letter of recommendation by highlighting my contributions and the value I've gained from the experience.\ntherapist: It sounds like you have a thoughtful plan in place to handle the transition professionally. Scheduling a respectful meeting with your supervisor to explain your reasons and express gratitude is a great way to preserve positive connections. Focusing on your contributions and the value you've gained from the experience can also help to secure a letter of recommendation. How confident are you in having this conversation with your supervisor?\nclient: I'm somewhat confident in having this conversation since I've planned what to say and how to express gratitude, but I'm still anxious about how my supervisor might react and whether it could impact potential references. Overall, I believe addressing my need for financial stability will help me stay true to my decision.\ntherapist: Your plan sounds well thought out, and it's natural to feel some anxiety about your supervisor's reaction. Remember, you're making this decision for your wellbeing and financial stability, which are valid reasons. When you meet with your supervisor, try to focus on your contributions and the value you gained from the experience. Would you like to practice some of the key points you plan to bring up in the meeting?\nclient: Yes, I'd like to practice some key points to help build my confidence in the conversation. This way, I can ensure I communicate my reasons effectively while maintaining a professional tone.\ntherapist: Sure, let's practice together. You could start by thanking your supervisor for the opportunity to volunteer and explaining that you've learned a lot from the experience. Then, you could share your need to prioritize your financial stability, which has led you to make the difficult decision to step back from the project. Finally, you could emphasize your desire to maintain a positive relationship and ask if they would be willing to provide a letter of recommendation based on your contributions. How does that sound?\nclient: That sounds like a helpful structure for the conversation, as it allows me to express gratitude and my reasons professionally while addressing my concerns about maintaining positive connections. Practicing this will likely boost my confidence in handling the discussion effectively.","completed":true,"turns":12}

Photography appeals to me for its creative outlet and potential in media, but I'm concerned about ensuring longterm financial stability in that field.\ntherapist: It sounds like you value both practicality and creativity in your career choices. Your concern about financial stability is valid, and it's great that you're considering that as you make your decision. Have you thought about ways you could potentially combine your interests in business and photography, such as starting your own photography business or working in marketing for a photography company?\nclient: I've thought about combining business and photography, like starting my own business or working in marketing for a photography company, as a way to merge my interests. However, I'm still concerned about whether that path would provide the reliable financial stability I'm seeking.\ntherapist: Your concerns about financial stability are understandable, and it's great that you're thinking about that as you consider your options. Have you looked into the job market and earning potential for business and photographyrelated careers in your area? That could give you a better idea of what to expect financially.\nclient: I've done some basic research on job markets for business and photography careers, but I haven't delved deeply into the specifics for my local area yet. This uncertainty is making me even more cautious about choosing a path that ensures longterm financial security.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're feeling uncertain and cautious about your career choices, which is completely normal. Have you considered reaching out to professionals in your area who work in business, photography, or related fields? Hearing about their experiences and insights could provide valuable perspective as you make your decision.\nclient: I haven't really considered reaching out to professionals in business, photography, or related fields yet, as I've been focusing on my initial research. I'm hoping that getting their insights could help me feel more confident about choosing a path that ensures longterm financial security.\ntherapist: That's a great idea! Networking with professionals in your fields of interest can give you firsthand knowledge about job prospects and financial stability. Would you like to brainstorm some ways to connect with these professionals, such as attending industry events, joining online forums, or even setting up informational interviews?\nclient: Yes, I'd like to brainstorm ways to connect with professionals, as it could help me gain clarity on career paths that offer greater financial stability. I'm particularly interested in options like attending industry events or setting up informational interviews to explore this further.\ntherapist: Great! Let's start by identifying local industry events or professional associations related to business, photography, or your other interests. Do you know of any such events or organizations in your area?\nclient: I don't know of any specific local industry events or professional associations related to business, photography, or my other interests in my area just yet. Exploring these could help me better evaluate which options might provide the financial stability I'm seeking.","completed":true,"turns":16}

Over the the amount of credits needed and still on my way to complete my degree.\nI tried to appeal they said no. Whole ordeal.  So now I owe 10k because of loss of scholarship. The next two years are now torture for me mentally and physically many factors. Leads to Depression. Identity stolen(ex stole messed).

Took time off I think I found my passion I could get into the program I want to pursue dental hygiene. So now I transfer to Hostos community college.

I'd like to explore some strategies to navigate this change.\ntherapist: That sounds like a big and important decision. It's natural to feel uncertain. Can you tell me more about what's making you uncertain?\nclient: I'm feeling uncertain because my past efforts in one field don't seem to align with my new direction, leaving me questioning if I'm making the right choices. This shift is making it hard to feel confident about my academic and career path moving forward.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you're questioning your choices when your past experiences don't seem to fit with your new direction. Change can be challenging, but it can also lead to growth and new opportunities. What's drawing you towards this new direction?\nclient: I'm drawn to this new direction because it resonates more deeply with my personal interests and offers a sense of fulfillment that I haven't felt before. However, it's still challenging to integrate this shift with the efforts I've already put into my previous path.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're being pulled by a strong sense of purpose and fulfillment in this new direction.

What comes to mind?\nclient: One aspect that excites me about this new direction is the opportunity to help others understand and manage their mental health, another is delving into the complexities of human behavior, and a third is the potential for personal growth through studying psychological theories. Exploring these elements helps me feel more aligned with my interests, even as I navigate the challenges of this shift.\ntherapist: Those are some compelling aspects! Let's build on that excitement by considering how each of those aspects could positively impact your future career. For example, how might your interest in helping others with their mental health translate into a fulfilling career path?\nclient: I think helping others with their mental health could translate into a career as a psychologist or counselor, where I'd be able to make a meaningful impact on people's lives and find daily satisfaction in that work. This excites me as it reinforces my motivation to pursue this path, despite the challenges of shifting from my prior efforts.\ntherapist: It's inspiring to see how your interest in helping others with mental health could lead to such a rewarding career path. Now, let's consider how your second aspect, delving into the complexities of human behavior, could further enhance your future career satisfaction.\nclient: I believe delving into the complexities of human behavior could enhance my future career satisfaction by allowing me to apply deeper insights in roles like research or therapy, making my work more impactful and engaging.

It sounds like you have a solid plan in place. Remember to communicate your goals and expectations clearly with your accountability partner, so they understand how to best support you.

However, I'm concerned that the additional time and cost might not be worth it if there's still uncertainty about better career outcomes compared to pursuing graduate studies.\ntherapist: It sounds like both options have their potential benefits and drawbacks, and you're understandably concerned about investing time and money without a guarantee of better career outcomes. One thing to consider is that uncertainty is a natural part of any big decision, and it's impossible to predict the future with 100 accuracy. However, you can make an informed decision by researching job prospects, talking to professionals in your desired field, and reflecting on your own goals and values. Have you done any of these things already?\nclient: Yes, I've started researching job prospects and sought advice online, including reflecting on my goals. However, I'm still feeling uncertain about whether these efforts will help me make the right choice for my career path.\ntherapist: It's great that you've already taken some steps to gather information and reflect on your goals. Uncertainty is a natural part of the decisionmaking process, but you can continue to build confidence in your choice by seeking out more personalized advice. Have you considered reaching out to professionals in your desired field for informational interviews or networking opportunities?\nclient: Yes, I've considered reaching out to professionals in engineering for informational interviews, as it could provide useful insights into job prospects. However, I'm hesitant because I'm worried it might not fully resolve my uncertainties about the time and financial investment required for further education.\ntherapist: That's a valid concern, and it's important to acknowledge that no single step can completely eliminate uncertainty. However, seeking advice from professionals in your desired field can provide valuable information and perspectives that you may not have considered before. Additionally, it can help you build connections and potentially open up opportunities that you wouldn't have otherwise. Would you be willing to try reaching out to a few professionals and see what insights they might offer?\nclient: Yes, I'm willing to try reaching out to a few professionals for informational interviews, as it could provide helpful perspectives on my career options. However, I'm still concerned that even with their insights, the uncertainty about the time and financial investment in further education might persist.\ntherapist: That's a good step to take, and remember that uncertainty is a normal part of the process. Even with the insights you gain from professionals, there will likely still be some uncertainty about the future. However, you can try to mitigate that uncertainty by creating a plan for how you'll finance your education and setting realistic goals for what you hope to achieve. Have you thought about ways to finance your education and what your ultimate career goals are?\nclient: Yes, I've thought about ways to finance my education, like scholarships, loans, and parttime work, but I'm worried about the longterm financial burden it could create. My ultimate career goals involve securing a stable engineering position, though I'm still uncertain if further education is the most effective path to achieve that without unnecessary risks.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're being very thoughtful about the potential financial implications of further education, which is a smart approach. One thing to consider is that while there may be some financial risks associated with pursuing further education, there may also be financial risks associated with not pursuing it, such as missing out on higherpaying job opportunities or limiting your career growth potential. Have you explored potential job opportunities in your desired field to get a sense of what kind of qualifications and experience are required?\nclient: Yes, I've explored potential job opportunities in engineering fields by researching job listings and requirements online, which has given me a better idea of the qualifications needed. However, I'm still uncertain about whether my current background aligns well enough or if further education is truly necessary to meet those demands without adding more risks.\ntherapist: Given your research into job opportunities and requirements, it seems like you're trying to weigh the potential benefits of further education against the risks. It might be helpful to reframe the decision not as a binary choice between pursuing further education or not, but as a series of smaller decisions that can help you move towards your ultimate career goals. For example, you could start by taking a single course or certification program to see how it aligns with your interests and goals before committing to a full degree program.\nclient: I think reframing my decision into smaller steps, like taking a single course, could help me test the waters without a full commitment, which appeals to me as a way to reduce some risks. However, I'm still worried that even these smaller investments might not fully clarify whether it's the right path for achieving job stability in engineering without adding to my financial burdens.","completed":true,"turns":24}
