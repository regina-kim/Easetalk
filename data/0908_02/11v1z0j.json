  "concern": "My 2 year program has a cohort of 30 people and I feel like I’m always finding out about gatherings after the fact. Last semester, I consistently saw Snapchat/IG stories and updates on bar hang outs, games, and more literally every week. Sometimes even more. But they were usually during or after the event. I tried to participate but how am I supposed to attend if I had no idea it was happening? And it’d get awkward when I was asking “what’s going on?” or “what are you guys talking about?”. Someone once even said “Poor (my name), she keeps thinking there’s a group chat for this when we plan it spontaneously”. I just get left out because no one tells me. I get that I’m more introverted, but I really do try to talk and participate in conversations and have been mistaken as an extrovert by an extrovert before. I’ve really worked on this over the years. And other introverts in the class somehow also find out about the events, parties, and gatherings. \n\nPart of me felt ok - I tried to make myself feel better by saying that those people just don’t have a life outside of the program. And that I wanted to have more of a balance. Seeing the same people 5 days a week a day PLUS some evenings and most weekends is a lot! On top of 5-6 classes and student clubs and volunteering, I have a GA position, casual job, serious relationship, family, and other friends to balance. I feel ridiculous and in the minority for feeling this way. \n\nNow that it’s March, there seems to be less of these events happening second semester, but it still hurts when someone sends a video or picture (e.g. group selfie) to the cohort group text and it’s like almost everybody is in it. This literally happened last night at 2AM for someone’s st patty party. I can’t silent the notifications or not check because sometimes there are important announcements to know. I try to shrug it off and not let it get to me but I feel ashamed that I’ve cried over this before.",
