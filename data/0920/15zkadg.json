It’s encouraging to see you consider these proactive steps.\n\nIn terms of next steps, setting aside some time this week to draft your initial schedule feels like a solid place to start. This might also be a good time to identify a few relaxation techniques you can easily access. Remember, it’s okay to be flexible and adjust as needed. You're making thoughtful decisions, and your willingness to adapt is a strength. We can revisit your progress in our next session and adjust as necessary. You're doing great with these insights and efforts!",

  "concern": "title: Does anyone else feel overwhelmed with college?\nIt’s my 2nd day being a Freshman on campus just moving in and honestly I feel so overwhelmed. I’m overwhelmed with worrying about my classes and being in a new environment and missing my parents :( I got placed in both Bio and Chem and I’m scared it will be too much and I’m going to fail. I keep hearing all these stories of people barely keeping up and having to study late into the night. Also how my professors say for every hour of class, study for 2 outside of class, that will lead me to have to study for around 17 hours cause my labs are quite long (not even counting my 2 other classes). I’m worried I won’t have any free time or life outside of college to pursue my hobbies or just have a life in general. Does anyone have any words of advice of words of comfort, im straight up not having a good time right now :(\n\nThank you for reading this",
