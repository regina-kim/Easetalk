Hence, my options are limited.\n\nI think this plays a major role in me being super, super anxious all the time in CC. I have 3 reports due at the end of this month, and despite almost being done with them, I'm worried that they're going to get bad grades. I've talked to the lecturers and tbh it didn't really help.\n\nFrom the second I wake up to the second I fall asleep, I'm either thinking about assignments, revision material, and a course I'm struggling in.\n\nI didn't really eat much for 2 weeks (appetite is almost non-existent), and I get these weird blood blisters in my mouth for some reason. I feel like I'm turning into a zombie. And I feel the need to cry a lot.\n\nAnd it's only been a month since the semester started.\n\nI think my main concern is the small range in universities\n\nI honestly don't know what to expect now that I've typed this out",
