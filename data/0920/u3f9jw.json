However, I'm always late in classes and midterms come while there is a ton I still have to study. Its exhausting because I dont get time to have fun and spend with my family. What's making me tired is what I achieve compared to the time and effort I put. \n\nI want to enjoy college and life and have the opportunity to finally understand what I'm learning not only for tests. Now that midterms are over, I'm looking for a new approach for college so I dont repeat the loop all over again.\n\nI'm very excited to hear your tips and thoughts.\n\nThings to put in consideration is that I'm a commuter. Commute to and back from college take about 2.5~3 hours daily + making me tired. Note, next year's commute is gonna be way shorter due to change of campus.",
