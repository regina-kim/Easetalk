It's not the work I came to grad school to do, it doesn't get at any of the things I wanted to study in grad school, and it's taken 70% of my grad school career that I can't get back, and I don't even make enough money to buy something that can distract me from how miserable I am. I have 1 month to get the thesis finished, and every time I open it I just start crying. I'm not even sure it's worth it anymore and I don't know what to do.
