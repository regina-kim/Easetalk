I was homeschooled all through out high school, which wasn’t the best for me and honestly I didn’t learn much. On top of that, my ADHD and depression have given me severe memory loss, so i don’t remember much that i did learn. I’m horrible at simple math, i still have to count on my fingers, and i have trouble spelling and sounding words out. I’m just really scared i’m going to look like a dumbass and it makes me not want to go. I was picked on in middle school for having learning troubles and i’m worried it’s going to be the same. That my professors or the students will think i’m stupid. What if they call on me during lecture and i don’t know the answer then everyone thinks i’m dumb lol. Please help, my anxiety is so bad i want to skip my first day.",
