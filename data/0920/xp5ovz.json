  "concern": "title: Quitting a sport\nI want to quit my club rugby team. I am a sophomore in college, and I am debating on if finishing out the season is worth it.\nI played spring semester last year, and this year hasn’t been fun. There are lots of good rookies taking up playing time, and my play isn’t as good as theirs. The coach is also an issue, as I don’t think he’s fit to coach as many people as he does, almost on his own. He doesn’t even speak to me. I love lifting in the gym, and I have had to put that second to rugby, as well as my social life and my part time job. I can only go out once a week with friends, due to practice 4 times a week and work.\nIs it a bad look to quit my team to open up more time for a social life and work?",
