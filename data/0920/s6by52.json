  "concern": "title: Do I bother trying to find research my final semester of college?\nI’m a dual degree student graduating in May. Due to COVID (yes, we’ve all heard it before) and overcoming some personal struggles, I have yet to work in a campus research lab. I did email some professors over the years, but they either didn’t respond or couldn’t take me on. Now that I’m in my last semester, do I bother trying to get into a research lab or let the subject go? \n\nI did complete a research internship this past summer and have a research assistant position in the same lab lined up for after graduation in order to prepare for graduate school in a couple years. Many professors won’t take on seniors because they can’t commit long to a project. To be honest, I’m not sure I want to put myself through the stress of finding a lab again, but I feel like a failure for not having participated in research at my school like many of my peers. Any advice?",
