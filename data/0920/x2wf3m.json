I was shaking, voice was shaking, watery eyes, short of breath, nauseous, the whole 9 yards. I spit out a presentation in 3 minutes because I was talking so fast. I’ve been known to get nervous for presentations but never have I ever had such a reaction. Maybe I’m overthinking it but I’m pretty sure everyone could tell how nervous I was too, which just makes it worse. \nHow do you guys cope? Does it get better? How does it get better? I’m hoping that as I do it more, my body will settle down but for now I really need advice.",
