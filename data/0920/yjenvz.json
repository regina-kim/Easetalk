  "concern": "title: MPH at 37? Currently an RN looking for a change\nI am strongly considering getting an MPH with an emphasis in health policy/data analysis. I am currently an RN case manager at a hospital and I'm tired of being \"bedside\" even though I don't work as directly with patients anymore. The role does not provide much growth unless I want to be in management and hospital management sounds like a nightmare to me. I'd like to go into health policy with some data analysis. I haven't been back to school since I graduated undergrad in 2007. Spent time staying home with my kids and I've been working regularly for almost four years now. \n\nAre the MPH programs hard to get into? I'm hoping my job experience gets me in. I left undergrad with a 3.3 GPA. Currently looking for an online or hybrid program, so far UMD (u of Maryland or BU online seem to have good options).  Any other suggestions for programs?  I'm hoping to stay under 40k.",
