  "concern": "title: Bored with the same thing day in day out and need advice\nSince I’ll be going back to school soon, I’ve been thinking about how much my life in college is lacking. I feel stuck in it and need some advice. \nI (20f) hang out with the same 2 dude friends literally every single day. I don’t have any female friends, and at times i feel like my guy friends don’t or cannot ever fully understand me and my feelings because of the gender difference. They are great friends, but they don’t like to go out at all, and they have very different interests from me that makes me feel excluded sometimes. But I just have nothing else to do most of the time (besides homework) that I end up just in their dorm 24/7 even if they’re just sitting there playing elden ring (which i’m not a fan of). I’ve tried branching out and trying to make other friends but it doesnt feel that comfortable and i havent found anyone that i click with really. I’m rooming with a girl I don’t know and I avoid talking to her because its awkward and she uses my shit, but I don’t want to spend another semester cooped up in their dorm wishing there was more to my life. \nWhat do y’all think i should do?",
