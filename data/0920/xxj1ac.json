  "concern": "title: College isn't conducive to those who work full time\nI work four days a week, which is full time in my state, and I go to college two days a week (two out of three of my days off). During the week, I still have homework to do, but I work all day and then come home absolutely exhausted. I have no motivation or energy to do said homework and usually wait until the day before to do everything. Taking three classes (a full time schedule) is what is needed to keep my financial aid, and while that's all well and good, I don't know how other people who work even more than I do can do this. I am at work for 8-9hrs each day, and at school for about 5.5hrs each of my two days, plus an online class. I have such a hard time doing school after work because I am so mentally checked out by that point that even getting myself to take a shower can be a struggle. And I have a hard time doing homework after I get home from school because I just spent all day at school. I'm just so over everything. I wanna go back to being five again.",
