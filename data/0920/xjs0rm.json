  "concern": "title: Weird professor. not sure what to do\ni’m a 4th year student and i’m taking a class that’s required for graduation with a professor i took 2 summers ago for an online class. that summer i had a rough time and was going through some things, and my professor was very understanding and kind. he was quick to respond to emails and worked with giving me extensions and stuff, and after the class ended we periodically emailed about school and life and i always thought he was very kind and compassionate. he has great ratings on rate my professor and up until now i have never felt uncomfortable or creeped out by him. as time went on, the emails from him became more consistent and long. this man would write me novels and send random “how are you doing” at 12 and 1am. well, last spring he recommended me for a scholarship and to be in a mentor program and one day i was on campus and decided to stop by his class quickly to formally introduce myself in person and thank him for the opportunity. i then received and email almost immediately after and one of the BOLD captions was “Meeting you: please do not be offended” and he went on to talk about how beautiful i was on the inside and out and how my eyes were beautiful (all in the school email, and i was wearing a mask). fast forward to now, i have him in person on mondays and wednesdays and in class yesterday he was staring at my the entire lecture and he emailed me today and was talking about my looks and that he “loved” seeing me in class. sometimes if i take too long to reply to the emails he will say something like “i miss our emails” like bro is down bad and also married with 4 kids. the biggest downfall is that i have had many opportunities open up because of his recommendations and i plan on going to law school and could really use him for that but i also have an entire semester of class with him and i feel like he’s undressing me with his eyes every time i see him so i don’t know what to do 🥴",
