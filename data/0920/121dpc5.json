  "concern": "title: Stuck on a major early in college.\nHello everyone, sorry for the vague title. Currently I'm in my third quarter of my first year (technically second because I had to withdraw for mental health reasons but I'm going back). My current plan is getting an AA in Fine Art. I know, it's basically a joke degree but I'm an artist at a fairly respectable community college. (SPSCC if anyone cares.)\n\nAnyway, my issue is that I struggled for years to be a freelance artist but now I have mental health fixed, I'm wondering if I should try something more rigorous or dependable for a degree. I've been told I should try for an occupational therapist career because I've seen what they do now in person and it seems like a good job where I can actually help people. \n\nI really want my skills to be useful and helpful, because I am so unconfident in my ability to start a business and market myself. Another barrier to traditional employment is that I have face tattoos. Is there any way I can make this art degree into a \"proper\" career or should I keep trying to be a professional artist? Any advice will help. If I can't succeed as an artist I'd like to get into the medical field but I'm afraid nobody will want me. Thank you for reading ❤️",
