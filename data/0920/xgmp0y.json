  "concern": "title: Made a huge mistake changing majors\nFelt this strong urge to change courses of study at the start of the semester. Justified it by evaluating possible better career paths down the line after the change. \n\nChanged majors from architecture to chemistry/pre-health. Now thinking I made a huge mistake because I don't enjoy what I'm learning about, and it takes so much more effort for me just to keep up with my new courses vs. my first year. I also feel stupid compared to my classmates, something I never felt before in architecture, like my brain is just hardwired differently and I grasp everything 3-4 times slower. \n\nMy first year was a lot of work too, but thinking back I always had this drive to get out of bed every morning to do it, compared to now where I have little to no motivation to move myself, aside from meeting deadlines. \n\nHas anyone else had this experience before? What should I do?",
