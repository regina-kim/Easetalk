  "concern": "title: after getting through school with increasingly worst habits, I have officially failed an entire semester.\nI should've known it was coming. I am so stuck, and beyond knowing what to do. \n\nSince the second semester of 10th grade, I have been depressed. I had spent about a year and a half obsessed with overachieving, eager to perform well, terrified of not living up to my father's expectations - and it had led me to a bunch of self-destructive study habits, that I didn't realize was harmful because it worked. Because I was GOOD at school, I was great at drawing, I was great at essays, I was lazy, but still determined and managed to get around to getting what I wanted out of myself. This is starting to sound like a very typical 'gifted' kid situation. But I really was good at a lot of things.\n\nI have this vivid memory of the first time I realized my body was *tired*. I had a deadline coming up for one of my classes, it was the night before, and I remember sitting in my chair, realizing that I wasn't stressed. That last-minute surge of energy I used to get hours before a deadline, that stress that I used to rely on, it didn't come. It was only after the deadline had passed, that my body sprang into action.\n\nBut I was lucky back then. The tenth grade and the years following. Granted countless extensions, had understanding and generous teachers - and at the end of the day, even if it was as if I had no stress or motivation left in my body, I would still get it done at some point. I didn't realize though, that even though I got through those assignments, it had made me insanely ashamed. I spent my eleventh grade suicidal because of how much I hated my brain for not working normally, for not being the way it used to be. I would have breakdowns every night before a deadline.\n\nWith every semester, it had gotten worse - I almost didn't graduate high school because I had waited till the day before the very last day of an online class to do an entire course's work.\n\nThen when I got to university, I barely scraped by. My first year had earned me a warning about my gpa. And I'd been so determined to do better. So determined to change - I've always been. The pandemic had torn my mental health apart - but it was okay, because now my classes were going to be in person, there was no excuse to not do well.\n\nFor the first time, this year, during the first semester of my second year of university, I failed every single class I attended.\n\n37 minutes ago was my final extended deadline to hand in a term paper. I am majoring in something I love, in something I'm privileged to be able to study.\n\nBut I stood there in front of a blank screen and did everything I could to distract myself from working. Going on my phone, scrolling through Twitter, playing games, apartment hunting, daydreaming while I listen to music, getting up to make food. Anything to keep myself from feeling any dread, and that would enable me to stay comfortable in my little bubble of self-hate and procrastination.\n\nIt's as if my brain cannot fathom putting in effort into *anything* anymore. I'd like to take a moment that this burnout has impacted all areas of my life. I don't draw. I don't write. I can hardly muster up the strength to write emails. I want so much for myself but it's as if this parasite in my brain manages to manipulate me into doing absolutely nothing. And now I've thrown away four months of dragging my feet through courses for nothing.\n\nI don't know how to change. I love studying literature, and I love the idea of school, but what's the point if I barely put effort into it? If I'm wracking up student debt just to fail? Just to throw it all away.\n\nI don't even know what to do. I'm afraid to tell my mother. She'll be so devastated, and she'll just blame herself. \n\nI don't even know the point of living if I'm just going to be on autopilot my whole life. If I'm just going to dream about reaching my goals, and never actually put the work to it.\n\nI wasn't even spoiled growing up. I was raised by a strong single mother that did everything to make sure I could have a life that I flourish in - but all I do is disappoint her. And my father. \n\nI'm sorry this was really long, but I can't talk to anyone about it and needed to just get it out there.",
