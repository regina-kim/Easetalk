  "concern": "title: major help please! any suggestions appreciated\nI’m currently a second semester freshman majoring in nursing. I recently realized that I don’t want to be a nurse anymore, and don’t know if I ever did. I do know that I like science, especially chemistry, so I was thinking of changing my major to chem. Did some more overthinking, and I don’t know if I want a career in chem or if I just like the subject?? Also I feel there aren’t many career options for a chem degree, besides chem engineering which I know I do not want to do.\n\nNow, I’m debating switching to something business-related, possibly marketing, accounting, or finance? I’ve read different things about marketing, some say its useless today and some say its great. I want a degree that is useful but also diverse and can give me options since I don’t know for sure what I want to do after college. I can see myself in marketing or real estate.\n\nObviously salary is important as well, and personally I’d rather have a boring/easy job that makes bank than do something challenging and not make as much money. BUT I also don’t want to hate my job and want to kill myself. \n\nI’m slightly introverted but can be outgoing. I like to think I’m good at math/analytics. I also like learning about human behavior and psychology.  I just don’t know where to go from here. All I know is I don’t want to be a nurse lol. Any help/pointers are much much appreciated. TIA!!",
