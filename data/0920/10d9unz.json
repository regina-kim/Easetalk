  "concern": "title: Research vs Project Dilemma\nApologies in advance for such a long post! \n\nI’m in a bit of a dilemma and thought I’d post here to get some feedback.  I’m in my last semester of a three-year MFA in design.  I’ve been developing my thesis since the first year (my program has you write the first few chapters during research classes) and solidified my committee spring of last year, which gave me a whole year to work on my thesis with them.  I sent my progress and documents over to my committee chair, who then didn’t get back to me for several months until I emailed him asking for an update.  Then we went back and forth with edits all last semester until I finally got a pre-proposal meeting at the end of the semester.  Then, despite my chair saying I was in a good spot, the rest of my committee didn’t like my idea or my methods and basically told me to start over.  \n\nSo now I’m in my final semester, with my funding running out.  There’s no way I can get though IRB review, conducting research, and revisions before the end of the semester and I need to start working full time this summer. I don’t want to have to be in thesis mode while starting a new job and I just feel really stuck (and stressed).  I knew I needed to be done at a certain point which is why I tried so hard to stay ahead of things.  \n\nI understand that setbacks like this are part of grad school and part of the research process, but it just doesn’t feel worth it for an MFA, especially because most MFA’s have final projects, not research-based theses.  I’m thinking about asking if I can switch to a final project I already have something partially developed that I think would actually be really great, but I have to convince them to let me do it and I’m not sure they will.  \n\nI just don’t really know what to do…. I really was interested in my research topic but if I’m going to be dragged through years of it I’d rather it be in a doctoral program.  I’m only 24 and I don’t want to push off my career for thesis that just keeps getting delayed.  But I might regret it if I pursue more research or a doctorate later too so I’m just kinda stuck and could use some insight if you have it.  Thank you.",
