  "concern": "title: Advice for busy full time students?\n\nI urgently would love tips that worked for you. Sleep tips/ study tips/common college programs for these/ etc..\nFull time student athlete who works here. I’m literally getting 4 hours of sleep avg. Been getting less recently.  Sometimes because of these there are labs that you can work on for straight 12 hours for 3 days and not be enough, and at times because I’m so stressed that I can’t fall asleep. Told few of my professors about this and their replies were to just manage my time well and “study ahead of time” like I’m not already studying here till 6am with my current classes. I totally would love to study ahead of time if humans didn’t need sleep and function well. Wish more professors cared sometimes. Professor who care thank you for understanding .\nSo any tips/advice would be greatly appreciated.",
