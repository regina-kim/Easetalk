I graduate in just a few weeks, but I have had such a blast this semester and made so many friends whom I feel actually care about me. I have depression but this is the happiest Iâ€™ve ever been. It may be silly and stupid to want to stay another semester to be with my friends, but Iâ€™m really afraid of growing apart from them especially since I live multiple states away from everyone. Iâ€™ve been wondering if I should take a minor in Graphic Design (Which is something Iâ€™ve been interested in for a while now) but I just donâ€™t know if in the long run it would be worth it. Has anyone else been in this situation before and has some advice?",
