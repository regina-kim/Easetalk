  "concern": "title: Students of reddit, any advice on how to keep at the studies?\nHi everyone!\n\nI'm in my third year of a five year computer science program in university. I had a real easy time with my studies in gymnasium, not only that I understood things easily but I also studied really hard. Now that I'm university I've noticed that my ability to study has significantly decreased.\n\nIt even started in my first year as I started failing classes, now I've fought real hard and made good progress and as such I'm basically where I should be in terms of my studies but I am still not happy with how much I study. Currently I might spend around 5 hours a day studying...\n\nI'm looking for advice on how to turn this around, how do ya'll do it? What makes you wake up and spend 8 solid hours on your studies five times a week?",
