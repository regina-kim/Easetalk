I have to register for classes for the spring semester soon so I think I’ll bring it up to my advisor there but I wanted other perspectives. I want to major in english with a concentration in creative writing. The only thing I could think of career wise would be teaching  but I don’t want to do that. Is it realistic to start my career as an editor and write a book on the ride to try and get a book published?",
