  "concern": "title: Can someone help me chose a grad school, the deadline for one of them is tomorrow\nI’ve been fighting demons these past night trying to come to a decision. I got into these three schools for a masters in mechanical engineering with thesis option. None are offering any money or assistance, this makes sense though since  I’m coming into a spring semester. I would need to take out loans my first semester regardless of where I go and get a part time job. All locations have accommodations for a hobby I have but I would like a friend to be able to hang out with, I’m too lonely in undergrad lol.\n\nOptions and some notes: \nUniversity of Florida- cheapest housing and some good possible opportunities for funding later down the line. Also has grad housing which is even cheaper if I manage to get one of those. I also have a chance at maybe getting a teaching position in the chem department as I teach chem at my current undergrad. Has cool labs and research in my concentration of controls and robotics.\n\nUniversity of central Florida- good school and a lot of jobs around the area that have benefits. I have a friend there so I’ll have someone to hangout with for about two semesters before they graduate. Cheapest tuition, housing can be as expensive as Manhattan although there can be plenty of options found.\n\nCity college of New York- very good school but they said they do not have a track record of offering assistantships for masters but almost all masters students come out nearly debt free. I’ll be able to live by my Aunty, which covers housing and food, on Long Island but the commute will be very long(~2.5 hour train ride or 1-1.5 hour drive during morning rush). I feel like the commute after working might take too much time from working on my thesis but I don’t really know how much time grad students actually have and I’m sure I’d adapt to it though. There are a lot of part time jobs in New York and CCNY federal work studies( I know other schools offer that as well).\n\nHealthcare is also very very important since I have recently been diagnosed with a few illnesses and need insurance to afford the medicine. This makes getting a job with benefits important if I stay in Florida whereas New York i can apply for Medicaid.\n\nI don’t know which one to choose, I like them all and each have their own cons. I also self toured all schools but it was kind of rushed since my parents was rushing to leave. \n\nI did apply to some scholarships and fellowships but they are for fall 23 school year. I would appreciate anyone’s help, I know it’s last minute but I just can’t make a set decision.",
