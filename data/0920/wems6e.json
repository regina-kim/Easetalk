  "concern": "title: Should I try to request a room change?\nSo, I’m moving out in 10 days. I’m staying at an off campus apartment because all the dorms at my college are on a waitlist. I got randomly paired with 3 girls, 1 I talked to before and 2 more that I didn’t. I’m not so concerned about the one I touched base with before as I am about the 2 others. This one girl especially just doesn’t seem like the kind of person I’d get along with at all - I know I shouldn’t be making assumptions but based off what she told me and looking at her instagram she seems like an extroverted popular party girl type. Not to trauma dump but most of the people who bullied me in the past have been those kinds of people. The other one I still am unsure about but I literally know nothing about her, she might very well be the same kind of person. I really don’t know if I’m going to be comfortable in this kind of situation. I know it’s kind of unfair for me to judge these people without having even met them but I have a bad gut feeling and I’m really anxious. I don’t want my first year away from home to be a living hell because I’m not able to get along with these people. I know I could try to set boundaries but who’s to say they’ll listen? \n\nAnyways, Im thinking about calling the rental office and asking for a room change but I’m unsure. I don’t know if it’s worth it because what if I end up in an even worse situation or I somehow lose my placement? I really want to go with my gut here but I just don’t know. Plus it may be difficult with this being a private housing complex and not a dorm.",
