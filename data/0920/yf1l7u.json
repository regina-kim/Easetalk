  "concern": "title: Thinking of applying, but I’m anxious…\nHi all, I thought this would be the best place to post this. I graduated with my BA back in 2018, &amp; I’ve recently been toying with the idea of going to grad school. However, when I looked at my transcript recently, I was disappointed in myself when I saw my graduating GPA. It was a 2.30 I believe. I certainly was not the world’s best student, and I made a lot of mistakes. I was also working full time and dealing with loss in my personal life. I consider myself an intellectual for the most part, and seeing that GPA just made me feel a bit idiotic. The school that I was thinking of applying to told me they typically require a 2.75 but that “there are possible ways around that”. I guess what I’m wondering is do I even stand a chance at all of getting into a master’s program anywhere? Due to work &amp; life I’d have to go the online route… I’m now 30 and much more the wiser but am just wondering if I should perhaps lose hope when it comes to the idea of grad school. Not trying to gain sympathy, just wanting some honest opinions. Thank you for your time if you read this!",
