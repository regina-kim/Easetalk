  "concern": "title: Mid-college crisis?\nHi. I hope I can explain this correctly. I just have this weird feeling and I'm wondering if anyone is experiencing the same. \n\nI'm a sophomore. It's my second semester (as I'm sure it is for most). I did my first freshman semester at an online community college, then transferred to university. I'm at a weird \"mid-college\" crisis, I guess? It feels like time has just flashed by; I'm already almost a junior. But, at the same time, I'm only almost a junior, if that makes sense. It feels like I don't have much time left in my college career, but also, I know that realistically, I have at least two years (especially since I'm considering grad school) left. I'm literally only 19, and I also know that I have a lot of time after college to experience life before I decide to settle down, but I also feel like I've not taken advantage of the time I've had before. \n\nIt's weird. I'm in a weird spot with my credits, and have been relentlessly pushing myself to fix the situation, so it feels like I haven't really experienced the less-academically-important-but-equally-mentally-important (in my opinion) aspect of socialization as much as I should have. I don't have many friends, but recently, for whatever reason, I've been really trying to get out of my shell and explore new things and make new friends. I don't know what came over me to do this, and I kinda wish I did this sooner. I guess I always thought it would happen naturally. I dunno. In high school, as a sophomore, I couldn't wait to graduate and be done. But now, as a sophomore in college, I feel the same, but I also simultaneously feel the opposite. I don't really want to join a frat or anything, and I've met people from mutual hobbies and clubs (as well as recently meeting up with some people from my university Discord server), but I dunno. I feel like I should've done more, and now that I'm approaching upper division college, I'll need to focus more on career and professional stuff. \n\nIs this weird? Does anyone feel the same or have had similar experiences?",
