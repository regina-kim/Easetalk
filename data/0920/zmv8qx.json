  "concern": "title: I had a miscarriage between two conferences (did not know I was pregnant until I was actively miscarrying) and have been on a mental and physical health roller-coaster the last 4 months. I feel so much better now, but want to be transparent, do I tell my PI what's going on?\nFirst, it feels weird calling it a miscarriage because my husband and I are not trying to get pregnant, I have a hormonal arm implant (Nexplanon) and am in no way ready to start a family nor am sure that's something I will ever want.  I have told my mum, and a few close friends, but haven't really referred it as a miscarriage because that implies a loss.  I am so unbelievably relieved and can focus for the first time in over 3 months.  My doctor and my counselor are great allies and have been so supportive while pushing beyond me saying this is \"just a normal grad school mental breakdown\". I had an IUD before the arm implant and had not had a period in 5 years, so we never considered I could be pregnant and I assumed I had gained a little weight from stress eating.  Lo and behold, there is a 1/100 chance of getting pregnant with the Nexplanon arm implant, but most likely to be unviable and ectopic so there was a chance I needed a D&amp;C which was very stressful and upsetting while busy with conference prep and international travel.  I am emotionally exhausted and did become heavily reliant on Zopiclone to sleep when I was having frequent anxiety attacks.  Now that I am feeling pretty emotionally good and weaning off the Zopiclone, I am not sleeping nearly as well without it, but on my way to feeling like myself again.  I'm still not 100%, and would want to acknowledge that something has been off about me if my PI does bring it up (which he has in the past when I've been noticeably down - I'm often described as an effervescent and vivacious person and have no poker face).  Also I am still mildly traumatized from seeing the...expelled tissue...and often can't shake the image from my head and that has not helped my sleeping situation.  When I write it all out, it sounds very dramatic and serious.  \n   \nOn one hand, I am mentally at ease after months of uncontrollable crying, lack of focus, and intense, disruptive physical anxiety.  I was still able to do my project management job well but I had to make some big changes about my thesis and got kind of paralyzed in my own research. I don't want to diminish that my academic life is still really stressful: I work full-time as a project manager and my PI is also my MA supervisor so we see each other several times a week.  He knows me well. We have a good relationship and he is very supportive of me as a human, a researcher, and a professional in my field from before going back to school.  He is a very nurturing supervisor and has been supportive during other losses I have experienced in our time working closely together.  On the other hand, I don't know if it's better to leave it at \"I've had an ongoing medical challenge but am feeling a lot better, looking forward to the holiday break and returning refreshed\".  There is such a taboo about discussing women's reproductive health so it would be easier to talk about if it was strictly a mental health issue - it feels so heavy and complicated, especially with holiday parties and everyone asking \"how are you?!?!?\" when I'm not great.\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.  I know other women who struggle with the dichotomy of academia vs family and work-life balance.  I feel quite alone in this as many of my friends are starting to get baby fever or actively trying to get pregnant.",
