I’m going into my third year after the summer and I barely have any knowledge of the subject I’m doing. I’ve had a difficult time learning online and learning computer science in general. \n\nI did some thinking and the only reason I want to switch is because I find computer science hard, which I don’t think is a valid reason for me, and it’s only going to get harder as I’m closing in on the major. I can’t decide if I want to switch to business or not. People say that business is useless and a waste of money, while computer science is the future and has well paying jobs. \n\nI’m so lost at what I’m supposed to be doing and it’s so stressful.
