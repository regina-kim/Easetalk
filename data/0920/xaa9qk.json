  "concern": "title: Will I be a failure for dropping out and working a minimum wage job?\nMy mental health has been really bad. I’m able to get a refund on tuition if I drop now. I’ve only been here three days (I’m in my second year) and I already am having mental breakdowns. My other option is to work at a retirement home, which honestly I don’t mind. I feel like it would relieve a load of pressure and stress off of me. \n\nBut I know I’d disappoint everyone in my life but honestly I’m used to that. Idk. I haven’t talked with my professors or anything. Idk anymore. I get so upset I feel sick. I really feel I’d be happier just going to a better school later while building my skills through some online stuff and books in my spare time (I’m in a tech program) and saving up for a course better suited for me when I’m ready and can take care of my health.\n\nIdk :(\n\nEdit : thank you all for the advice. \nI’ve made my plans. I’ve requested withdrawal forms. I talked to my mom and grandmother and they supported my decision, so I can live with them with low rent now. I plan to work and pay off my loans (they weren’t very much) the first year and then I plan to work for another year or two and save up for a school better suited for a program that I would be happier pursuing. I hope to seek mental health help too so I can function and gain life experience before going back. Thank you guys again. I read all replies and appreciate them all.",
