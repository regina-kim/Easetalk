I currently have a 63% in the class. I was almost on my way to reaching a B, but FAILED the mid term three weeks ago, along with more than have the class. This is the second time I almost reached a B, only to get dropped back down to a 62%.\n\nI want to be an engineer, but this class is the most draining I have ever taken and my first physics course. I put in many hours of the week into other classes such as General Chemistry I (5 credits) and Calculus II (4 credits) (both which I have borderline Cs in). I dedicate mostly to physics (5 credits).\n\nI’m sure to blame for the strenuous amount of work I attempted to do this semester, but I would like to (stereotypically) put some of it on the  professor. He assigns homework but no explanations are given when not answering the problems correctly, you lose points on your grade after a certain amount of attempts. Mid term was a disaster since we did not have enough time. He does not curve exams or quizzes.\n\nDrop date is April 15th. Advice? Should I just stick with it and try to pull through? I just feel lost and down on myself now. Professor was pretty demeaning other day when he said if we don’t get a B or A in this course, we will really struggle in the next physics class (electricity and magnetism).",
