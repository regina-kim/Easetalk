  "concern": "title: Is it normal to be UNDERwhelmed first semester?\nFreshman here majoring in Computer Networking. I’m finding that majoring in networking is like comp sci without the majority of programming, or cybersecurity without a lot of the math requirements that major usually requires. \n\nI’m afraid that i’m not spending enough time in my classes/on assignments. I’m taking 16 credits right now (four classes with two labs) and I’m underwhelmed by the workload. \n\nMy comp sci and math classes are the only classes I really put decent time into. My english class is a composition course, and I only have essays as my grade.\n\nI’m also taking a networking course, but I took this same course last year so I’m familiar with the material. \n\nAm I not spending enough time? Did I just get lucky this semester? I was told all my life that the college workload was crazy, and being done with all my weekly work by Wednesday makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong",
