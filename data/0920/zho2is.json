  "concern": "title: A Friend and Terrible Project Mate at the Same Time\nMy friend asked to team up with me on an important course project which I valued very much. The whole course is evaluated totally based on the project. I accepted the invitation because I am actually the dumb one among us. However, in the project, I got mad at him. Whenever we came across problems, he would say he didn't know anything and \"sorry, I really can't help you\", as if this was my personal project. I talked to him so many times about this, and he was tired of me pushing him to think. Then right before the deadline, when we had trouble meeting the minimum requirements, he said he didn't think we need to meet the requirement, and I shouldn't care so much about the project. I worked for two whole weeks with little sleep before the due date, but still, I didn't get any results for the report in the end. When he said \"I am sorry that you didn't get the right results\", I almost shouted at him.\n\nI feel awkward now talking to him and disappointed with this collaboration. I don't feel proper to complain to the professor. We are friends and still need to meet on lots of occasions. My complaint can make things more complicated. Is there any way to make myself feel better and let go?",
