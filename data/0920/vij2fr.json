My tuition for both schools are covered completely by financial aid that I don't have to pay back, so my only financial issue is cost of living. Since I've committed to TAMU, I've already found an apartment, done all the pre-NSC requirements, and have my NSC in a couple of days. However, some events came up where I am now unsure as to whether I can even make it at TAMU without constantly being stressed about finances. I honestly don't care at this point about which school I attend, but my only issue with UTD is that I would be living at home and commuting there which is roughly 45 minutes to an hour. If I have a morning class this would be a bit of a problem. Even though this issue isn't really that big of a deal, I would really like any advice about how to navigate this.",
