I’m thinking maybe it’s too late to switch programs, and I can just study International Relations (or maybe Social Work) for my Masters. \n\nBut I’m not sure if my undergraduate degree will be qualified for that kind of masters, since it is two very different fields. May I ask if your undergraduate degree matters when educational institutions look at your application for a Master’s Degree?",
