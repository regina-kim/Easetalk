I’m scared of how people will treat me in college\nI’ve finally committed to stopping self harm for good, and I haven’t done it in a long time, but my scars are going to be with me for life, no matter how much they fade. They are clearly self inflicted. It’s going to be pretty difficult for me to hide them at all times, especially if I end up living in on-campus housing. What would you do if you had a classmate or roommate with old scars like mine? I’m afraid that I’ll attract people who think I’m an easy target or that people will avoid talking to me if they know that I used to self harm. I’ve gotten a lot of negative and extreme reactions to my scars over the years. Some people have made it very clear to me that they think wearing short sleeves is selfish and that I should simply face the consequences of my actions and cover up no matter what in order to spare people the “horror and shock of seeing my arms”. To what extent do you agree with them? Should I just get sleeve tattoos and skin grafts in order to avoid all this mess as soon as I turn 18? Would you be uncomfortable around someone who looks like me? Would you think that I’m a freak or that I’m crazy?",
