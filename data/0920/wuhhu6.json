  "concern": "title: Recommend gap semester?\nShould I take a gap semester?  Hey everyone, I am currently at community college trying to transfer as an Aerospace engineering major. I was taking a summer math course until I had a health emergency come up and it took me out of my class. Ever since then, I feel like I haven’t been myself. I’ve noticed that the things I used to be so passionate about are fading away and I don’t know why. I was taken out of my rhythm and it’s hard to get back on track.  Classes start next week, and I don’t feel ready at all. I have the pressure from my parents and my little sister who will be going to college after this year. I am feeling a bit lost and I was wondering thoughts on taking a gap semester. I feel like I need to be outside more, get into better shape and try to regain my passion for the things I loved. I started kickboxing and I’m loving it, I also have a job as a barista so I’m working trying to get a dirt bike and a new computer. Overall, I really want to be in college but I feel I need a small break. Thank you. :)",
