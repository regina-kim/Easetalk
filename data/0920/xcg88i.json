  "concern": "title: Torn between getting a business, psychology, or creative computing degree\nIf you've taken any of these 3 courses before, what advice would you give someone who is choosing between them?\n\nI'm in Creative Computing right now but I have the option to transfer while its still early.\nI chose it because it seems like the course that has the most potential for a good job in the future, considering where the world is headed.\n\nHowever, I find maths and coding a bit challenging. It was our first coding class today and I already felt left behind. Some of my classmates already studied the basics before they went into uni so I felt really dumb.\nI know I can learn it as I go along but it just feels really daunting. Like can I really do this for my whole life? \n\nI used to be interested in taking Psychology or Business but after seeing all the advice online from people who have Psychology and Business degrees... they mostly say that they're \"useless\" unless you do a Masters or be good at networking. \n\nPart of me wants to take on the challenge of doing a more difficult degree while another part of me wants to go the more comfortable route. I'm a pretty sociable person and I'm good at writing essays and being creative, that's why I chose creative computing because I thought it would be more creative but the coding part is what I find difficult.\n\n... what do you think?",
