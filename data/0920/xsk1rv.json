  "concern": "title: What should I do?\nI’m a recent highschool graduate from the class of 22’ I always wanted to go to college and try to further my studies. I lost almost half my highschool education due to covid so getting back into school hasn’t been the easiest thing, in highschool I managed 90s in everything but I never had to pickup a book. I decided to try something different and study a 2 year 4 semester autocad degree, within the first 3 weeks i quickly realized i didn’t care for it so I switched my major to business. My actual major starts next semester and this current semester has 9 weeks left. I’m struggling at every corner even when I apply myself and try to study the material. It’s extremely demotivating when your first college semester is something that isn’t your major, I don’t care to learn any of this because I don’t want to do it. I want to drop out and continue my studies next semester or later on within business. But I don’t see a reason in sitting here learning material and putting in endless hours into something that provides me with almost nothing in return or the only good return being the discovery of something I hate. I go to a fairly cheap community college and financial aid eliminates about half of my overall 2 year tuition which is only 5,600 before aid. My parents keep telling me I’m just lazy, that I dont actually want to do anything except smoke weed and hang out with my girlfriend. Whenever i bring up the idea of a trade or anything else i’m immediately told i’m not cut out for it and that my best option is to sit here and suffer for the next 100 days. Every day is taking such a heavy toll on me just trying to manage to stay afloat everyday and getting through to the night is so difficult right now. I’m not even in classes that are that difficult, but they don’t affect my major and i’m so demotivated to be doing what i’m doing right now. What should I do?",
