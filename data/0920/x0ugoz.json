  "concern": "title: Is it worth it to get two Master's degrees?\nFinishing up my Bachelor's this semester and going through the process of getting ready for my Master's. There are two programs that are very appealing to me and would both be beneficial in my future career. I favor one slightly more than the other, but I can get the one I favor less for 50% of the cost because of the internship I am currently in.\n\nWould it make sense to complete the discounted one, and get the other afterwards if I still thought it would be beneficial? Each program is an online intensive that takes between a year and a year and a half to complete, so theoretically I could have a Bachelor's and two Master's by the time I'm 25, which sounds worth it to me. I'm a first-gen college student and the only person I know from my family who has pursued a graduate degree, so I really don't know what is standard. Any advice?",
