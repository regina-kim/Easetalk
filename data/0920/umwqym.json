I'm studying to be a vet because I love animals first but the bloody stuff seems really cool.\n\n I know police officers may stumble upon dead bodies/murders which is one thing and I know doctors (or vets) see medical type gore but I wonder what other jobs deal with such? It can deal with law enforcement or medical field, I just want to know besides the common typical jobs/majors.",
