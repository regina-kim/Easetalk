I know that in state tuition is a big factor when choosing ,but I really like Michigan Tech. Michigan is a place I've always wanted to visit and live in, it is also when my dad grew up and recommends going there. My high school stats are considered above average but barely, luckily Michigan tech is not extremely competitive either. So should i either go to Michigan tech or University of Alabama Huntsville (maybe Auburn as well). I want to be creditable and go to a good school but I don't know which one is objectively better for internships and overall teaching.",
