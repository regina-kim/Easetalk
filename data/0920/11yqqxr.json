I get shivers and random boost of energy and heart pace increase through out the day. I haven't drank coffee for more than a year.\n\nI go without feeling hungry for a long time. And this may sound weird but I don't even feel horny anymore. And at night I won't sleep until like 3 am because I have so much energy, but if I try to get up and something I can't\n\nThis has been going on for like a week now. And it just gets worse and worse as The days go on and I see how much work I have to do. I also get in like a dream like state and sort of zone out.",
