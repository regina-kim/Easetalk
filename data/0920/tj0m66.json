  "concern": "title: college is making me feel super lonely\nI started going to college this year and it started off really great but now I’m really lost. I got to college in august about 2 months after a really rough break up so i was already a little depressed but i ended up making a good group of friends on my dorm floor that i hung out with very frequently. i was rooming with a friend of mine from high school, but i moved out this second semester as he was the worst roommate ever and just a really shitty person and friend in general. all of my friends thankfully took my side in the situation, but now that ive moved i dont see my friends that often at all anymore. my friend group had like 8 or so people in it with 2 or 3 i felt i had a genuine connection with. now i live in a suite with 3 guys i get along with but never really talk to. i don’t really text so i really only get to see and talk to three of my friends from my old dorm like maybe once a week. there are some who i haven’t even seen since i moved out 2 months ago. i’ve honestly never been more lonely and depressed in my entire life. my mental health was already not the best going into college but my friends helped me forget about it. now i find myself alone almost every day with no motivation to do anything and all i can think about is how lonely i am. I was already struggling with my grades but managed to stay afloat my first semester but now it’s even harder to do my school work and go to class. i want to reconnect with my friends or even make new ones but at this point in the semester im so lost as to how i would even do that.",
