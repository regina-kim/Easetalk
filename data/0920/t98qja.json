  "concern": "title: Facilities Engineering or Mechanical engineering\n\nSo this semester (last semester of sophomore year) I have the option of switching between Mechanical Engineering or Facilities Engineering before I'd get behind if I decided to switch beyond this point. I'm very divided on what type of engineering I want to focus on and I know it's for me decide on what I really want to do. I just want to see what peoples thoughts are when they are stuck in this type of predicament and what I should weigh when deciding.\n\nBackground: I go to SUNY Maritime and instead of a minor I am trying to pursue a USCG 3rd engineers license. For those of you who have no idea what it is, it allows people to work and run a power plant (steam, diesel, diesel electric, nuclear if you get certified but not many civilian ships use nuke) on a ship along with HVAC, plumbing, fresh water generation, electrical work, etc. I plan on using this license to ship out for at-least 5 years after I graduate in hope to be able to sit for my chief engineers exam. I'm worried I'll fall behind the curve with a mechanical engineering degree as I won't have as polished skills when I leave compared to my peers who go immediately to land side jobs. With facilities engineering I feel like I would be building work experience with it. The thing I like about mechanical is the flexibility and broadness that comes with it. \n\nI am also happy to answer any questions you have about the program I am in :)",
