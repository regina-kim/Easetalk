It feels like everyone I know and everyone around me has a group of close friends already that they do everything together with and I just don’t have that. I have lots of different friends form different groups but I don’t my own group per se. Is this normal??? I’ve joined a lot of clubs and even though I don’t go out every single weekend, I do go out every now and then with my roommate and some friends. It just sucks  everyone have their own group already while I haven’t experienced that whatsoever. Someone please tell me it gets better ahahaha.",
