I have regular doubts about if this was the right choice.  \n\nCurrently have almost completed the masters portion of my program.  \n\nIt honestly feels like the longer i am here the more I doubt my decision to come here.  I feel like I had a lot of passion prior to coming here that school has now squashed.  \n\nI was always encouraged to just pursue my area of interest and I think the general area of research i am interested in but it i feel like I was deceived about the nature of the program and the research I would be allowed to do.\n\nIts never been clear exactly what job prospects exist and anytime i talk to someone I get told wildly different things and I dont really know what to believe anymore.\n\nAnyways any thoughts are much appreciated.  Thank you for your time.",
