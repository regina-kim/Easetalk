I’m having trouble holding down a job in this field and I think part of that is that it’s not really the field for me.\n\nI’m considering going back to school to become an art teacher because I have been doing a part time art teaching job right now and I’m enjoying it a lot. I want more opportunities in this field because art is my true passion. I have two big worries though. One thing I worry about is taking on even more debt since I have so much and the other thing I worry about is the fact that it’s entirely possible that I could end up still struggling to hold down a job due to mental health stuff.\n\nI’d love to hear some input from you guys about what I should do since it’s a big decision.",
