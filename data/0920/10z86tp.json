(I have a group of friends, but we can't hang out much due to our schedules.) And this loniness has only gotten worse. But the thing it, I also realized I don't even know how to talk to new people. I've never needed to in years. \n\nI'm going to take in person classes next semester, but I feel like I won't even be able to talk to people since I just don't know how, I haven't had practice with it.\n\nI'm scared of feeling even worse though, what if I do take in person classes and I'm still lonely... then what? Am I just screwed?",
