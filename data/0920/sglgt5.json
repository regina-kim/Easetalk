From what I could tell with the first two classes, is that the professor is truly knowledgeable and knows what he’s talking about. The problem is that his lectures are kind of confusing, and when the class finishes, I feel like it doesn’t help me to better understand the material. I’ve also heard his exams can be tricky. I’m scared that I’ll fail this class, I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I failed. How have you dealt with failing a class?",
