  "concern": "title: Paranoid and Concerned Low Income Student\nOkay so I’m a low income student and I’ve recently been admitted to an Ivy on a really big scholarship (basically full ride) and I’ve been having concern about my academic performance. My school is a pretty non-competitive school and most of the curriculum we’re taught is pretty much dumbed down to ensure everyone passes and graduates. I’m scared that I won’t be able to handle the curriculum thrown at me at an Ivy because I didn’t have a good foundation from my high school compared to other students. So my questions are: \n\n1. Are remedial courses included in my scholarship? If I have to take a remedial math course but I can’t afford then what 🥲🥲😳😳😳\n2. Are there free college courses anywhere I can take over the summer to supplement my learning? I was thinking about my local community college but I don’t to spend too much since I’m kinda broke😅\n\nPls help",
