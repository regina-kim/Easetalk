  "concern": "I am a first year college student and 2nd semester is starting this week. Due to covid, the whole span of my senior highschool  and 1st semester of my first year in college is done through online class. I spent my vacation with family and the nights are killing me and not giving me sleep due to anxiety. I have a 9:30am face-to-face class later and I am writing here to ask for suggestions. I am introverted and often have a hard time to be with new people. Right now, I am living on my own nearby my school as it was far from my hometown and I think I am having a much harder time to sleep due to the new environment. Any advice for sleeping or socializing would help.",
