  "concern": "I'll be honest, I didn't go to college because I wanted to. I did it because I was expected to. My parents always harped on the necessity of getting a degree in order to have a better chance of getting a high-paying job. While logically I agreed with them, I couldn't get my heart into the grind.\n\nSo I spent my four years winging it. I was outstanding in some classes, mediocre in some, and near-failing in one or two.  When I was close to failing grades, my parents sat me down and made me decide: get myself together and finish college without near-failing grades happening again or drop out and get a job. I chose to grit my teeth and finish up because I didn't want college debt and nothing to show for it.\n\nFast forward and I finally got my degree. I wanted to get out of graduation real quick. I grabbed my paper, got my transcripts, and moved on to life. A year later, I enlisted in the Army and haven't looked back since. No, I didn't commission and become an officer. I enlisted.\n\nI'm writing this post to reflect on college five years after obtaining my degree. I've just finished paying off all my debt, and it's only struck me now how little I cared about those four years. I barely remember the faces and names of my former peers or professors, I didn't make a single friend, and I certainly don't remember anything from what I learned. In hindsight, my college life was so indifferent.\n\nDon't get me wrong; my degree has given me certain privileges and respect and I aim to take advantage of what I have. I'm actually at a point in life where I'm ready to willingly take the next step and get my master's degree. Still, I acknowledge that at the time I was an undergraduate, I wasn't truly ready.\n\nFor those who are done with higher education, what do you remember about your time?",
