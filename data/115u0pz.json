  "concern": "I recently committed to a college that I will be starting at in the fall. I’m majoring in Psychology, and the school recently reached out to me and asked if I was interested in their degree in 3 program. Basically I would be going year round, with tuition and room and board paid for during the summer, so that I would be done in 3 years rather than 4. \n\nCurrently, without the program, I would graduate with $20,000 or more in debt. With it, I would come out debt free. I’m planning on getting my Ph.D., so the money aspect of this is huge for me. It would also allow me to get a head start on grad school. \n\nI’m just worried I won’t be able to handle going to school year round, and that my social life would be negatively impacted by it. Thoughts? Is it worth it?",
