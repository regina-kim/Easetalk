  "concern": "Before today, I had never heard of college professors giving out pop quizzes. Today, however, when I went to my pre calc class for the first time, my professor mentioned that he will occasionally hand out pop quizzes  to make sure that we are constantly studying, instead of only studying right before exams/normal quizzes. Before now, I didn't even know that pop quizzes were actually a thing. I always just assumed that they were just made up for movies. Is this normal? Or is my professor just weird?",
