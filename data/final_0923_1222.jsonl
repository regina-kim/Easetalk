I admit that I got really really lucky, and would not be here if I wasn't already an internal candidate. I have been told that I should leave this job now anyway because it pays so low compared to other jr dev positions. I took the low pay because it is my very first jr dev job and I did not have much room to sell myself and didn't want to lose the opportunity because I got greedy with money.\n\nI want to take a break, but I keep reading it is an absolutely terrible idea to take a break and that companies look down on that and that it will make it much more harder to go back to school. When I started my associates degree, I was 25 so I was already out of high school for a good 7 or 8 years. I feel like I could do a year break and get back into it.

Should I go for an associates or masters? If associates, is there a way I can do 2 at the same time with schools that don't offer dual enrollment (from what I know)?\nThis might be very detailed, and I have several dilemmas to cover. I'll try to get it all in one go.\n\nI'm graduating with a bachelors in graphic design this December, and I've been thinking of either going for associates or a masters. I don't know which one would benefit me the most, but also with a masters there's a problem: my grades have always been low. I struggle with a LOT of mental health issues and I'm lucky to even still be in school. I got myself  together and got the help I needed, but unfortunately the damage  to my GPA is already done.  I figured since I might not get into a grad school, I could just get my associates.\n\nSo since grad school might not be an option, I wanted to think of backups. I was then thinking of doing associates, and that a lot of people to multiple. I decided I could do an associates in Fashion, and one in Music production. Music has always been a huge passion of mine, I want to learn how to create beats and music and maybe a little writing. I thought I could maybe find schools in NY that offer both, but it turns out thats not so much of an easy option either. TNS offers music, but not music production (as far as I'm aware of). But their fashion program is good and you can make good connections. I looked up some CUNY schools, Queens college offers a good music program and is way more affordable, but not a fashion associates.\n\nI thought about attending both at the same time, but I don't know if either of them offer dual enrollment, and I don't know how it works if you've already graduated with a Bachelors. I don't know if I'm able to attend both or not at all. Or if there are schools that offer both at a good balance.\n\nI want to hear some advice, or if there are other programs\/directions that I'm not looking at or considering. ANY advice is very much appreciated! Also I really want to get this done in as little time possible. I lost so much time due to mental illness, I don't want to feel like I'm wasting more time.\n\nTLDR (kinda): Basic list of my questions:\n\nShould I go for masters or associates in the fields I'm looking into (music production and fashion)?Do I still have a chance at getting into grad school?Am I able to do 2 associates in different schools that don't offer dual enrollment (as far as I'm aware)?Are there other schools that offer both associates or is there another way I can achieve this goal of mine that I just haven't seen yet?\n\nEdit: I REALLY want to emphasize the not wasting time part. I lost YEARS due to really bad mental illness. I don't want to wait around anymore. I'm set on continuing school on these majors that are unrelated to my bachelors. I just don't know the best way, which is what I want to know. Regardless, I still will be establishing my career, but I do want to do the rest of the things I want to do in my life. And I don't want to be \"find out later\" what works the best for me. I want to just do it all now. I hope this makes sense and thanks to everyone for the advice already given.","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

I'll be starting university in September, majoring in economics. But I am doubting myself a bit mainly because out of the seven courses I've taken in grade 12, it looks like my lowest grade will be economics. My grades range from 90-95%, with economics being the 90%. The median grade for my economics class was 90%, hence I performed average relative to my peers.\n\nThe thing is, is I studied so much for that class, did all the textbook questions, took notes, etc. because I am passionate about the subject. I can not imagine studying anything else. Despite this, I still finished average in my class. Perhaps because some concepts (e.g. graphs pertaining to competitiion theory like monopolies, oligopolies, etc.) didn't \"come naturally\" to me.\n\nMeanwhile, there were people in that class who are not even going into econ like I am, and are pursuing careers like engineering and computer science, and they took economics because according to them, it's an \"easy course\". Some of those people barely attended class, were disruptive during the lessons, yet got 95+ because according to them, all the concepts came naturally to them and therefore they barely had to study or do practice questions in order to succeed.\n\nSo yeah, after my performance in grade 12 economics, I've been constantly questioning whether or not this is the right major for me. But even though I'm bad at it, I'm still passionate about it. I've read *Capitalism and Freedom* and *The Wealth of Nations* in my spare time because I'm truly interested in economics. Everyday, I spend time reading news relevant to the ongoing cost of living crisis, rising inflation, rising interest rates, etc. Yet I performed so badly in that class.\n\nIf there are people who are able to effortlessly score 95+ and treat economics as an \"easy course\", but I barely scored a 90 while taking economics seriously, how on earth am I going to succeed as an economics major?\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is this still the right major for me?","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

I'm probably a terrible student at best of times and throw in some shitty life events that JUST GOT WORSE during covid and those downstream events, I'm sitting here writing my 3rd SAP appeal for Spring 2022 due tomorrow, and IF it gets approved, I will be writing another one for Summer 2022. My housing depends on it, so that is not good. And if my appeal doesn't go through I will also owe the college unpaid tuition and housing for 2022.  \n\n\nYEAH I KNOW. Its so bad. It just took me a while to figure out who to talk to when I realized things were off the rails and by the time it got to Financial aid advisor, she was pissed (I don't blame her, and I have worked with her before, she's great), and we only have a couple days.  \n\n\nWorking backwards. Fall 2020 was super fucked up. Had adhd medication problem and had to try and fail on different medication. Couldn't pay rent, and landlords turned off heat to force eviction and or\/payment (didn't care about eviction protection and refused to fill out assistance paperwork), dealt with that but it wasn't pretty. And then I got covid and was dead sick for 3 weeks. Basically gave up on school and tbh, almost life. \n\n  \nFast forward, skipped Spring 2021, and enrolled again fall 2021 as I got covid rent assistance so felt I could. But it also kinda fell together last minute and I didn't have financial aid together yet (actually enrolling after start of classes) In the process of getting caught up, my landlords ended tenancy even though they had additional months rent (2) so had to move. Once moved, used the issues with rent and landlord on that SAP appeal for fall 2021 with the resolution being getting into university housing.   \n\n\nGREAT! Appeal when through, got aid towards end of semester.   \n\n\n**SPRING 2022 Appeal reason For Fall 2021 incomplete** Not great. I was super behind in my in person dance class because I missed a bunch. We made a plan to get me caught up if I attended the rest of the classes and the other students helped me get caught up for the final group dance project. One class later, the professor gets covid, cancels the rest of the classes and tells everyone to do a much abbreviated project. But now I have a lot more to figure out on own. Still seems doable, I have video of the last day we met and what the the dance routine was. I'm lost, but its doable. But I ask for more time given I'll have to figure out on my own. He agrees. Then a few days later, my grandmother dies, and I had to ask for another extension (and I felt like he was going to think I was lying at that point, but it happened). At some point, I'm getting back to trying to get the final project done, and I am just lost. But I'm trying, my tooth breaks from clenching my jaw and I just kinda stop, decide I'll figure out what to do next later \n\nBut, as you can guess from my user name, never did. Start spring 2022, I now have an incomplete and no financial aid. I dunno if I am going to appeal or if the instructor will allow me to turn in. \"I'll figure that out in a few days, I say.\" I didn't. Because I got my aid so late, I just used the refund to pay for a lot of what I needed for second semester. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summer 2022 Appeal Reason for Spring 2022** A couple weeks into 2nd semester, I'm floundering. I haven't figured out what to do about aid and late dance class final and instead of dealing with it, I just kinda.. gave up. Got myself into the university counseling center, they started me on antidepressant, once I got out of the worst of it, I was just racing to catch up on school work. Which I didn't get caught up fully when I realized I needed help and was in WAY over my head. But by the time I kinda got to talking to the right people, it's basically the end of the semester AND HERE WE ARE NOW. I am going to have to take an incomplete on another class, and another I have to argue and beg with professor to allow makeup work for missed in class activities. He agrees and I should pass (know material, aced two prior tests, so I'm current on the information, just not the work. Exam at end of week) On top of that, the mental health care provider thought my adhd might be slight be undermedicated, and she suggested that we increase the dose, but that has turned into a mess, with problems with the insurance (she wanted to use two different types of pills, a XR IR combo), with confusion at the pharmacy, with delays in the prior auth and with the school not having escript capabilities for adderall, and then a medication shortage, so I have to call around and find one that has brand adderall in stock, plus she is work from home right now due to some office construction on campus this week, so I'm literally waiting for a paper script in the mail. Almost a month since that started we've been dealing with the adderall problem and its not resolved so I'm working non-medicated and spending way too much time dealing with that.  \n\n\n**Right now, I am working on and need to finish my Spring 2022 SAP appeal tonight for 10am tomorrow.** I am writing it out now, the financial aid advisor said I should keep it to being about my grandmothers death and my instructor getting covid and canceling classes, thus changing the plan that was supposed to help address the missed course work. I am not supposed to use the broken tooth because it's still broken and even though I am enrolled at the dental school near me, its been a slow process getting that underway and I'll have to do god knows what to pay for the crown. So my financial aid advisor said not to include it because it's not resolved.\n\nI would really love some advice\/insight. I need this, really need this and I've been working on it since this afternoon, trying to write out the series of events but feel like I'm either over or under-explaining. I'm also stuck in what is the resolution to my grandmothers death? If I say its the depression that I had treated now, then I won't be able to use for the next appeal.","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

They are my going-out group and I love them, we always went out to parties and had fun (and we also have close and genuine friendships outside of that). Problem is, ever since they all turned 21 they often abandon me at the end of a night out to go to the bars which I can\u2019t go to (college town and they check thoroughly). I end up being left to go home alone which makes me feel so abandoned and lonely.

I totally get going out to the bars and I don\u2019t want them to stop but it\u2019s the making plans with me and then excluding me halfway through the night that I find hurtful.

I'm interested in going back to school next year for both networking and career growth. I have 6 years of work experience with a BSc in Engineering Management and currently work at a MANGA company and make a good salary. As mentioned previously the draw for school is in networking but more specifically also gaining additional skills to potentially create my own \"data insights\" company. \n\nI'm looking at two full time programs from Stanford - the MS Management Science &amp; Engineering (MS&amp;E) and the MBA. I was also looking into the MSCS program but fear it might be too technical and not provide enough of the financial and managerial science needed to build a for-profit company from the ground up. While taking 2 years away from work would a massive loss in earning potential, I've read the Stanford MBA completely overshadows the MS in MS&amp;E in terms of prestige (goes a long way for career opportunities and negotiations at the C-level). On the other hand, the 1.5 year MS MS&amp;E program is very flexible in terms of direction in the degree and would provide more technical courses which could come handy in the eventual creation of a data-focused company. \n\nAny graduates from these programs or people who've hired them present here and willing to chime in? Any and all thoughts\/opinions are welcome!","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

This one girl especially just doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of person I\u2019d get along with at all - I know I shouldn\u2019t be making assumptions but based off what she told me and looking at her instagram she seems like an extroverted popular party girl type.

I work in a systems neuroscience lab. Therefore, one of the things you probably guess that we do are surgeries, except I could never learn how to do them. In short, the post-doc who taught me was not a very good teacher and the lab environment has not been the best for learning. I was taking so long to learn them that my PI basically said that the staff research scientist would do all my surgeries while I focused on building other skills. This has been probably one of the single biggest blows to my confidence as a researcher. A skill that I was sure I could learn. Everyone else in my cohort was able to learn them but me, and I cannot get over this. I hate being the only one who seems to not be able to do a very core thing in systems neuroscience. \n\nAny advice is welcome. I am trying my best to look past this, but it's hard.

What's the deal?\nI keep running into this issue where instructors will often give vague instructions on assignments and I'm not sure what to do about it. Do I just need to get better at navigating vague teachers? Or is this not supposed to be happening?\n\n___\n\n**Exhibit A:**\n\nFor example, I just got my grade back for a programming project in which I was apparently not allowed to edit certain parts of the code that was provided. I got docked quite a few points for this mistake so I double checked the grading rubric and there is no mention of any restrictions on editing the prewritten code. I scroll down to the very bottom and of course, hidden in the middle of an FAQ section, is the warning to not edit prewritten code. Yes, I should probably be reading every single word of every piece of instruction just in case, but isn't the FAQ generally optional reading? Why is there crucial grading criteria in an FAQ section and but nowhere to be found in the actual \"Grading Criteria\" section?\n\n___\n\n**Exhibit B:**\n\nAnother professor, this same quarter, docked me for not formatting the output of a program in exactly the right way. The rubric does mention that \"the output must be in the required format\" but it didn't specify what the format is. While I was working on this assignment, I read through the whole rubric a couple of times and couldn't find any other mention of a \"required format\". When I turned it in, I added a note on canvas that basically read: \"I wasn't sure what you meant by required format. Please let me know if there are any issues. I can send you the source code if you need to look at it for grading purposes\".\n\nShe graded the assignment with a very dismissive response saying simply \"Numerical output was not in the required format\". I had to ask her again about this \"required format\" and she  responds with \"There was a sample line of code provided in the PDF file\". I look back at the instruction PDF and there is an example piece of code much later in the assignment that states \"you ***may*** use fprintf() to output a ***desired*** format\" but the wording does not suggest in any way that this ***is*** the ***required*** format above. The wording makes it seem like a completely unrelated suggestion or helpful tip rather than a strict requirement, especially since it appears many paragraphs after any mention of a ***required*** format.\n\n___\n\nAm I losing it? If this is happening in multiple classes in the same quarter then it must be me right? But I feel like there are *definitely* some huge communication issues going on. I'm not really sure what to think. Hopefully this post doesn't come off too ranty. I'm just not sure what to do. Why does this keep happening? Is interpreting vague instruction just a skill I need to develop? Or should I be talking to my teachers about this?","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

This turned out very long, I apologize.\n\nTo start out i would like to say this: I love physics, ever since i was in elementary school i've loved physics phenomena, lasers, optics and had marvelled at the fact that we can explain so much about the universe. I took physics as one of my Leistungskurse (elevated courses with more hours in German high schools), did my hs graduation exam in it and finished with an excellent score. I really did enjoy it all the way and our teacher was super chill and supportive, in general all my physics teachers were very cool and made our lessons fun with many very interesting experiments. It's a language that we can explore the universe in and that makes it very exciting.\n\nSo it's no wonder i went into university pretty determined on physics, however i didn't make my decision based on one specific job i wanted to do, but coming from a thirst for knowledge.\n\nIn high school, my strategy was to pay attention in lessons and thoroughly write everything down and take notes. I wasn't the kid that caught up to everything the teacher said in the lesson and when preparing for exams or revising I would sit and go through everything by myself. This was a very good method for me personally because i could understand the concepts and their connections in my own pace and understand things through my own methods. It might sound weird that the kid who was regarded as one of the top students sometimes couldn't have answered the most simple questions on a new topic, but that's how it was, i just needed the time.\n\nBut ever since the bridge courses before the semester i've been struggling. I'm told that it's normal for first years to feel like everyone around you knows everything and only you are behind, but after a semester the feeling is still strongly there. I will admit I have made many mistakes, like starting the more in-depth math courses from the beginning and not revising after every other class. As the workload was immense, I barely slept in the first two months. This in turn lead to me barely being able to stay awake in class and tutorials. I acknowledge these mistakes and have already made adjustments to lighten the load.\n\nNow, as for uni, the sheer amount of stuff we have to learn, on our own, at my university -which might be a normal amount, given this is university- is a lot to approach with my method. We were advised to study in groups and do our weekly exercise sheets together, and though I had some moments of victory where I could do one exercise, mostly it consisted of the other students talking about the topic like they understood it really well while I sat there and listened for any coherent crumbs of info and sometimes asked for a tip on how to proceed. Admittedly this was not a good method and I found some people closer to my pace who I could study with, but they weren't always there or we ended up sitting with our sheets well into dusk. So by the time I got home I was tired and turned to my phone for an escape lot of the time. Now I know that delaying catching up with our topics is a bad strategy due to time and the amount of material. But it seems like it's good if i take the time to catch up and revise by myself, also because the way things are explained in class don't always work for me.\n\nAs for the social aspect of it, there wasn't really a time where I felt that I fit in or that I have much in common with anyone there except maybe when we were talking about art. I also found myself rethinking my choices a lot. I missed my friends and my family immensely and honestly struggled to feel human at times. I haven't really been able to find the motivation to study beyond the desire to get through another week.\n\nWhen I look into what kind of scripts belong to classes in later semesters, the topics seem interesting, still it's pages of text with about the same amount of equations which i'm sure contain so much interesting and informative stuff.. Still right now that aspect of \"woah that's so cool\" is kind of missing. Maybe that will come later, i figure when we get to more stuff that's beyond mechanics.\n\nI suspect I might also have ADHD and may be nd in other ways which i will get checked out with a professional if i am able to. So to be clear i'm not self diagnosing, but i'm constantly reading up on these subjects and honestly everything seems to make so much more sense.\n\nSo that's a little bit on how I have felt about my first semester of physics.\n\nThe thing is, beside physics, I'm also very interested in biology. Our university has a small biology faculty and it seems to be much cozier than 200-300 people in physics. The longer i've thought about it, the more i find myself interested in life and the parts of science that deal with living things. I took biology as a Basiskurs (a course that has less lessons and is more simplified compared to Leistungskurs) and I loved it. At school i've done several presentations in both physics and biology (and ethics) and I loved doing those, I find it's so much fun to research things and share them with others in a way that's engaging and comprehensive. I watch science videos and listen to podcasts in my free time as well, like Scishow (both vids and podcasts) and books like The Selfish Gene (that i found super interesting and recommend!!), and generally beside physics, a lot of them have a lot to do with biology. I find that these pieces of media don't overwhelm me and i want to know more about them, in general all kinds of stuff that have to do with life feel like tangible things to me and they kind of fall into place in the big scheme of things. I hope i phrased that in a way that's understandable.\n\nI will implement new strategies in the coming semester and am in the process of hopefully getting a private tutor. I'm determined to go through my second semester in physics and reevaluate things after, but the way things are looking for me mentally right now, i think going with something that is naturally and directly engaging and has a sense of novelty and many little rewards that are directly applicable (so: biology) would lighten the load for now. Going into uni i talked with some advisors from both faculties on doing two bachelors, they said it was possible but i should rather wait. I would even consider doing them one after another with no overlap (of course i'd have to start working a job too eventually, to afford rent and basic expenses, right now i have a very amazing scholarship and mainly my parent's support paying for that)\n\nThe direction that would unite like, almost if not all of my interests well (given my current level of being informed) would be neuroscience. I think it's just in the sweet spot between big stuff and small stuff -ie. humans between particles and the universe and it has that direct application to life that i'm looking for as well as physics and biology. My dad is a surgeon and he has inspired me a lot to look into things that have to do with humans and with medicine, and when we learned about the brain in bio in hs i was always like \"heh i can't wait to learn more about this\". So far it's been the most definite career that i could see myself pursuing in the area of science. I want to help people and i want to feel like i am needed.  \nI still wish to pursue physics, because i love it after all and I Want To Understand Those Things!!!!(tm) also the experience and learned methods are definitely very valuable and give good prospects. I know it will remain a passion. But maybe it could be better to do it when I have the resources, support system that i also have control over, and maturity to do so.\n\nTLDR: first semester of physics was a lot to handle partly because of inexperience and partly because it's A Lot, took a toll on me mentally. Implementing new and improved strategy for second semester, will see how things turn out. However, also want to do biology at one point, maybe doing it earlier would benefit my mental wellbeing more? Would love to combine both in future job, not sure of the road to there though.\n\nQuestion to you: Have you had any experiences like this? Is it worth it to keep pushing? Will things change?  \nAlso: if you have experience starting out in physics and then going into biology later (maybe even not from a bachelors, like from a masters with overlap in bio or a job) how is that road?\n\nThank you kindly if you read this far and if you have any questions i'd gladly answer, I know my points are a little bit all over the place.","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

One month in and I am barely holding back my tears. I know it wasn't going to be easy but I took a subject called mathematical foundations, and I am absolutely unable to comprehend it. The other 2 subjects i took are definitely hard but i feel like with an extreme amount of effort, i can do my best and learn well. But with math foundations, i don't know what to do. I don't know how the rest of my classmates feel about the subject, but i do know that one friend is finding it quite easy. I have spent several hours going through the basics of linear algebra and it still doesn't change the fact that i am not able to comprehend the subject. I'm not saying I've given up, but i want to ask if this is a natural feeling that some of you all may have felt for some subjects. How did you get through this, and 4 semesters of this?

Now, i feel like its either sht or get off the pot and im not sure what i should truly pursue a degree in.\n\n\nI spend all of my free time making music, its a huge passion and hoby for me that has landed me a few really nice paychecks but betting everything on that would be insane. other than that i spend my time reading self help books and learning different aspects of finance.  \n\n\nMy gf has asked me to join her in the medical field but it doesnt peak any interest. My buddy has always told me i'd be great at what he does in the behavioral health field and that does sound super interesting and purposeful to me but i havent done enough of it to know.\n\n\nI feel like im looking for something that could umbrella a career and all of my interests. Like, maybe a degree that would require me to learn skills that can be applied to music and personal finance like some type of management or accounting thing. Even then, ive never really met an accountant that made enough money to just be an accountant. \n\n\nDoes anyone have any pointers?","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

Engineering major with a minor, consulting\/big tech company\/a less technical job that makes good money is the goal.\n\nI\u2019m someone who never would have thought i\u2019d ever consider something like this, in no way am I seeking \u201cthe college experience\u201d or anything like that, to start. I see the (fun) social aspect of college to be quite superficial, and in no way is that playing into this idea. All of this in centered around being successful \/ not failing life. \n\nA little background for how college has been so far:\nI\u2019m not doing great and I have nothing going for me \/ to assure me i\u2019m going to do well at all. GPA is currently at a 3.4 calculated before this semester ends (don\u2019t expect it to hurt it much more but it def won\u2019t get better). In terms of classes, I feel as though i\u2019m doing poorly, even at the things that shouldn\u2019t be too difficult, and I feel as though i\u2019m in a huge academic hole. I don\u2019t see how much grades could really improve. Extracurriculars: none. I gave it my all in applying to professional clubs that would have very much helped my ass but I was never accepted, and that was when I didn\u2019t look like a dumbass in comparison to my competition (a lot of people). Professional experience: I\u2019ve had a couple stupid summer jobs but nothing ever remotely relating to my major or area or interest i.e. working at a restaurant. so none. social\/networking: none. I have an extremely limited social circle, messed up and got \u201cstuck\u201d with a lot of higschool friends, have no connections to any job\/internship\/good club prospect and my parents\/family have no such connections either. I can talk to people and make a good impression, but i\u2019m bad at \u201cputting myself out there\u201d. \n\nMy concerns for my situation:\nI need to be good at something (grades, knowing people, etc) but none of that is going well and I don\u2019t see how I could improve it. I\u2019m ambitious and to get to where I want to be in my adult life I need to be good at something. when it comes to a job or an internship or any future prospect I don\u2019t see why anyone would ever pick me, I know I wouldn\u2019t.\n\nI used to be extremely successful with everything I did. I had very very good grades at a well renowned private high school and got into many very good universities (didn\u2019t attend because of money and I thought this \u201cmade sense\u201d). I was on par or better than all the peers I can\u2019t remotely compare myself to now (at the same college where they are doing just fine). I am extremely unhappy with my life now. I don\u2019t do anything fun, I just work. My university is very work hard play hard, but all I do is work without success. I hate that I see zero indication of being the person I want to be in terms of success. making money matters to me. my parents worked their asses off for me and put a massive investment into my education and I couldn\u2019t feel more guilty with myself for fucking it up especially when I used to go above and beyond for them before. I wish I could start all over from scaratch. if I had no one counting on me I seriously would consider dropping out with how much I hate this. i\u2019m reaching a limit with how much effort i\u2019ve been giving to and idk how much I can keep going. \n\nI find this school very unsupportive of students like me and again I feel really stuck in terms of the people I know and the social situation i\u2019ve put myself in . Another goal of mine is to live somewhere else. my thought is that if I transfer away I can be someone i\u2019m not, and at least attempt to build a network of people I know in a place where my desired field is much more accessible as an attempt to increase chances of being hired. even if that doesn\u2019t work and I fuck that up too I could start my failed adult life in a place I want to live?","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

I\u2019ve been developing my thesis since the first year (my program has you write the first few chapters during research classes) and solidified my committee spring of last year, which gave me a whole year to work on my thesis with them.  I sent my progress and documents over to my committee chair, who then didn\u2019t get back to me for several months until I emailed him asking for an update.  Then we went back and forth with edits all last semester until I finally got a pre-proposal meeting at the end of the semester.  Then, despite my chair saying I was in a good spot, the rest of my committee didn\u2019t like my idea or my methods and basically told me to start over.  \n\nSo now I\u2019m in my final semester, with my funding running out.  There\u2019s no way I can get though IRB review, conducting research, and revisions before the end of the semester and I need to start working full time this summer. I don\u2019t want to have to be in thesis mode while starting a new job and I just feel really stuck (and stressed).  I knew I needed to be done at a certain point which is why I tried so hard to stay ahead of things.  \n\nI understand that setbacks like this are part of grad school and part of the research process, but it just doesn\u2019t feel worth it for an MFA, especially because most MFA\u2019s have final projects, not research-based theses.

I was brought in to work on a few collaborative projects where the PIs and my advisor are not the same people. This was never mentioned to me, and I happened to find out when an undergrad and I were talking. For various reasons, any and all projects I was supposed to use for my thesis are either disjointed, have been delayed, or will no longer happen (it's been an entire semester and I've done no work on anything). Turns out my advisor merely \"consults\" on 1 of them and failed to mention she is not a PI on any project right now, is powerless to move them along, and seems to care a little less every day. This is slowly becoming more of an issue that could possibly keep me from graduating on time. \n\nIs any of this unusual, or is it just how it goes in academia sometimes? Is having an advisor who is not my PI problematic?","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

My last final was three weeks ago, and I just finished junior year. I work very hard and do well in school, but once it ends and I go from a rigid structure to nothing I feel disoriented and directionless.\n\nPart of it is that I feel the need to be constantly making progress. Another part is that I am pressuring myself to be figuring out my career path, because I hate not knowing exactly what I want to do. I'm good at school, but I'm also afraid that I won't be good at working and applying my skills to practical situations.\n\nSome of these fears are irrational--I've worked before, I've done great and I've discovered some aspects of my career that I like and dislike. I want to explore the medical field but I'm not sure if I could be hired for only 3-4 months as an entry level worker and then leave to go back to school.\n\nBasically summer gives me lots of generalized anxiety about my life and future that I don't have time to stew on during the school year. I know the obvious solution is to make arrangements for summer plans ahead of time so I don't run into this, but I had a short term change in my living situation and so I'm in a new place away from my university and feeling like everything is unfamiliar.\n\nSo much empty time and I'm not sure what to do with it.","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

I did my first freshman semester at an online community college, then transferred to university. I'm at a weird \"mid-college\" crisis, I guess? It feels like time has just flashed by; I'm already almost a junior. But, at the same time, I'm only almost a junior, if that makes sense. It feels like I don't have much time left in my college career, but also, I know that realistically, I have at least two years (especially since I'm considering grad school) left. I'm literally only 19, and I also know that I have a lot of time after college to experience life before I decide to settle down, but I also feel like I've not taken advantage of the time I've had before. \n\nIt's weird. I'm in a weird spot with my credits, and have been relentlessly pushing myself to fix the situation, so it feels like I haven't really experienced the less-academically-important-but-equally-mentally-important (in my opinion) aspect of socialization as much as I should have. I don't have many friends, but recently, for whatever reason, I've been really trying to get out of my shell and explore new things and make new friends. I don't know what came over me to do this, and I kinda wish I did this sooner. I guess I always thought it would happen naturally. I dunno. In high school, as a sophomore, I couldn't wait to graduate and be done. But now, as a sophomore in college, I feel the same, but I also simultaneously feel the opposite. I don't really want to join a frat or anything, and I've met people from mutual hobbies and clubs (as well as recently meeting up with some people from my university Discord server), but I dunno. I feel like I should've done more, and now that I'm approaching upper division college, I'll need to focus more on career and professional stuff. \n\nIs this weird?

So I've been trying to change labs for a bit now. My relationship with my advisor has gone from bad to worse and the relationship can no longer be salvaged. For the past few months, my PI has repeated refused to support any accomplishment or research venture I had. The PI doesn't even fund any part of my PhD as I am a fellow in a dry lab with no resource costs. Even my conferences, poster printing, and publications I've had to pay for out of pocket. \n\nRecently, I began speaking to a new PI in my department about changing to their lab. They were initially supportive of it but just wanted to make sure things were cool with my current PI before I changed. I let my current PI know I was planning on changing labs and made the commitments to finish up all the pending work on a paper I was working on with them as a corresponding before leaving the lab. The current PI said they understood and supported the move. This was surprising but didn't think anything else of it. A few days past and now the new PI has pulled back their support after speaking to my current PI. I spoke to my current PI today and they sounded pleased with themselves regarding me not being able to leave. They gave me an ultimatum which drastically limits my dissertation if I wanted to stay in their lab after all of this. I'm sure the current PI (who is know for being petty and spiteful) meddled and prevented my change from going through. \n\nThe lab I was hoping to change into is the closest to what I'd like to do for my PhD at my school. My current PI has essentially put me being a rock and a hard place, making me chose between either continuing under them with major re-shifting of my dissertation, or leaving the program entirely. I don't know how I can possibly salvage the relationship with the other PI I wanted to change to in the hopes of changing to them still. It feels like I'm a prisoner of my PI. Any advice?","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

I really don't want to trouble them with my uni fees especially that they've spent 7000$ on my tuitions and school stuff. my boyfriend is saying that this is an opportunity that I shouldn't miss but he doesn't get it, his family is rich and they plan on sending him to study medicine in another country so he doesn't understand why I feel so guilty. my mom said I should study English and since I'm already good at it I won't have much trouble. to me, I'm flexible, I don't mind studying anything but it's still a hard decision to make\n\nedit: I really didn't think anyone would notice this post but I need to thank you all. I read every single comment and they're all so helpful. the reason I don't have a major in my mind is because I'm good at any subject in hand and maybe, just maybe because my parents always decided everything on my behalf lol.

I know there's nothing like an easy major and that's what I've been trying to tell them but yeah. my mother only suggested studying English so I could be an English teacher. i mentioned that in my country we can apply to universities depending on our marks, the less you get the less options you have. also studying in another country or in another city in my country is not an option lol. again, thanks a lot for your help","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

My plan is to explore it as a minor after talking to my advisor, but I\u2019m not sure how close to the actual major that would be.

I\u2019m also completing a senior thesis and getting certified to teach middle through high school English. Right now I\u2019m looking through graduate schools, prepping for the GRE, and working on thesis, but the more I look into the programs I\u2019m interested in, the more I\u2019m realizing I will likely not be accepted. \n\nThe biggest reason is the language requirement. Most of the programs require fluency in another language upon entry. However, others require it by the end of the first year, meaning you\u2019ll have to start at an intermediate level upon entry. I was originally minoring in Spanish, but for many reasons I won\u2019t go into, I had to drop it. I picked up a Writing Studies minor instead, but now looking at Graduate programs in Comparative Literature\/Cultural Studies\/etc. that I\u2019m interested in, I know I should\u2019ve gotten that minor in Spanish. However, I don\u2019t have space in my schedule to make up all those credits in my last year. I also can\u2019t afford summer classes. For the few programs that don\u2019t require you to come in fluent, I\u2019d technically only need one other Spanish class to meet their requirements. \n\nHowever to top it all off, I\u2019d actually prefer to learn a different language. I would still love to learn Spanish at some point, but my undergrad thesis is focused on Chinese American literature. I\u2019d prefer to focus the rest of my graduate studies on that field. My university only offers French and Spanish, so I\u2019m out of luck there. \n\nThis brings me to my question. Should I apply for graduate programs, cramming in some beginning Chinese program during the summer through CIEE or something similar through my university\u2019s study abroad to bring me to the bare minimum intermediate level? Or should I take a gap year studying abroad to gain a much higher level of fluency, take a break, and give myself more time to consider all my options? I\u2019m afraid of what Graduate admissions will think if I take a year off, and there\u2019s always the possibility that I won\u2019t be accepted or be able to afford a year studying abroad. It could end up being thousands of dollars in debt wasted when I should\u2019ve just gone straight into grad school. \n\nAny advice is welcome. Even if you think I should suck it up and just take the Spanish course!","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

I had a deadline coming up for one of my classes, it was the night before, and I remember sitting in my chair, realizing that I wasn't stressed. That last-minute surge of energy I used to get hours before a deadline, that stress that I used to rely on, it didn't come. It was only after the deadline had passed, that my body sprang into action.\n\nBut I was lucky back then. The tenth grade and the years following. Granted countless extensions, had understanding and generous teachers - and at the end of the day, even if it was as if I had no stress or motivation left in my body, I would still get it done at some point. I didn't realize though, that even though I got through those assignments, it had made me insanely ashamed. I spent my eleventh grade suicidal because of how much I hated my brain for not working normally, for not being the way it used to be. I would have breakdowns every night before a deadline.\n\nWith every semester, it had gotten worse - I almost didn't graduate high school because I had waited till the day before the very last day of an online class to do an entire course's work.\n\nThen when I got to university, I barely scraped by. My first year had earned me a warning about my gpa. And I'd been so determined to do better. So determined to change - I've always been. The pandemic had torn my mental health apart - but it was okay, because now my classes were going to be in person, there was no excuse to not do well.\n\nFor the first time, this year, during the first semester of my second year of university, I failed every single class I attended.\n\n37 minutes ago was my final extended deadline to hand in a term paper. I am majoring in something I love, in something I'm privileged to be able to study.\n\nBut I stood there in front of a blank screen and did everything I could to distract myself from working. Going on my phone, scrolling through Twitter, playing games, apartment hunting, daydreaming while I listen to music, getting up to make food. Anything to keep myself from feeling any dread, and that would enable me to stay comfortable in my little bubble of self-hate and procrastination.\n\nIt's as if my brain cannot fathom putting in effort into *anything* anymore. I'd like to take a moment that this burnout has impacted all areas of my life. I don't draw. I don't write. I can hardly muster up the strength to write emails. I want so much for myself but it's as if this parasite in my brain manages to manipulate me into doing absolutely nothing. And now I've thrown away four months of dragging my feet through courses for nothing.\n\nI don't know how to change. I love studying literature, and I love the idea of school, but what's the point if I barely put effort into it? If I'm wracking up student debt just to fail? Just to throw it all away.\n\nI don't even know what to do. I'm afraid to tell my mother. She'll be so devastated, and she'll just blame herself. \n\nI don't even know the point of living if I'm just going to be on autopilot my whole life. If I'm just going to dream about reaching my goals, and never actually put the work to it.\n\nI wasn't even spoiled growing up. I was raised by a strong single mother that did everything to make sure I could have a life that I flourish in - but all I do is disappoint her. And my father. \n\nI'm sorry this was really long, but I can't talk to anyone about it and needed to just get it out there.","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

Currently I'm in my third quarter of my first year (technically second because I had to withdraw for mental health reasons but I'm going back). My current plan is getting an AA in Fine Art. I know, it's basically a joke degree but I'm an artist at a fairly respectable community college. (SPSCC if anyone cares.)\n\nAnyway, my issue is that I struggled for years to be a freelance artist but now I have mental health fixed, I'm wondering if I should try something more rigorous or dependable for a degree. I've been told I should try for an occupational therapist career because I've seen what they do now in person and it seems like a good job where I can actually help people. \n\nI really want my skills to be useful and helpful, because I am so unconfident in my ability to start a business and market myself. Another barrier to traditional employment is that I have face tattoos. Is there any way I can make this art degree into a \"proper\" career or should I keep trying to be a professional artist?

Not in a psychology way however. I'm unsure what degree best fits my desires in discussing these topics and interacting with others. However, the catch is that I also like discussions and analysis in things that aren't related to collective people, but maybe something about dreams for instance, unless it still connects to people. \n\n\n\nI have quite some time to pick a major as I'm in 11th grade, however I believe I mad some changes in what I degree I wanted to pursue. I originally wanted to major in communications and minor in journalism, but I noticed how I have a keen taste for commentary and analysis essays in regards to concerning phenomenons that take place omg societies. For example, I watched a video on collective trauma as a generation and how that plays out, and how the video mentioned the \"spectacle\" in which people are more focused on what could conform to it (such as wanting representation in the media more than being focused on what could help with agriculture in the world). The person in the video said this, but I started to realize how often this takes place now. (I'll love to go into more detail, but I get carried away with writing lol) Anyways, it made me begin to rethink what I want to pursue as a degree, and what could compliment me the most. I enjoy asking questions and socializing, however I love analysis and understanding topics in regards to how people function based on what the topic is. Carl Jung deeply interested me because of my favorite boy band implementing ideologies into their music. Which led to me question if his takes are sociology, or philosophy. I want to intergrate either one with communications, as I aspire to be a journalist; or something similar to one. I know what I'm seeking out in a degree, but not sure what degree has what I'm looking for in the future. I'm intrigued by Carl Jung's theories on dreams as well, but not sure if that's sociology or philosophy either. I like watching those videos, or see something online that could seek to be controversial or a touchy opinion, and begin to ask peers, family, or others online what their stance is on it and why. Why do people have the tendency to gravitate to someone harmful for them? Why is it hard to understand how dreams work? The relations in the subconscious and unconscious? How does this affect the functionality of people? Etc. I want to turn it into a career path, something to pursue. But I don't know what name to put to it. I mad an essay on why is it hard to be ethical online too. I can't just simply tell if sociology or philosophy is the name, or if they go hand in hand. Heck, if I can do both in college whole still minoring in communications. I'm unsure if either will be able to help me have a stable career future as well.\n\n[What best explains the type of videos I watch](https:\/\/youtu.be\/jlIBGl5-j_4)","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

I know that if I insist, he won't stop me but I don't want to have to deal with the awkwardness considering that they would know everytime I go for a session since I'd have to kick my younger sibling out of the room.

Posting here because I think this is the same (probably still less) workload as most of you have and I genuinely don't know how to manage everything. And thinking about this is making me fearful of what's going to happen when I start grad school myself. \n\nAnyway, I'm a first time TA, and I started this out by being super energetic and responsive to students, and this is a class of 260 kids with 4 TA's in total for it. I'm the head TA, so along with dealing with student questions and grading and stuff, plus holding weekly office hours and practice sessions, I'm handling most of the managerial tasks along with it like maintaining data for everything along with organizing stuff and continuing to email the class about any and all updates about anything. Because of this, most students contact me when they have an issue, and obviously I'm going to respond to their emails, and I have to make sure they understand stuff, because this is a calc-1 class with a majority of non-stem students. I've even been setting up extra zoom meetings with some of them, which have ranged from anywhere between 30 minutes to 1.5 hours. \n\nThe problem with this is. I can't find time to do anything else. I haven't been focusing on my courses at all, and I have a midterm in about 14 hours that I haven't even begun to study for. I have two more midterms in the next week, and again, no idea how I'm going to deal with them. The most I do is complete assignments, but some of them can easily take anywhere between 2 days, to a week (the latter for a very difficult pure math class). I also need to complete, or at least continue my senior year research project, but I haven't done anything with it for nearly a month now. I genuinely just can NOT find time for anything. And that's especially if I'm trying to make sure I have a good sleep schedule (nothing extreme, but at least 5-6 hours every night) along with maybe taking out an hour or two for myself in a day (which includes time taken to eat or nap mostly). \n\nI just genuinely need advice. How do you handle everything, alongside doing justice to each of your responsibilities and NOT overburdening yourself to the point of complete burnout? Do you set up schedules? I'm really sorry for posting here, but I have no idea where\/who else to ask and I'm seriously going to end up completely incapable of doing anything if it continues like this.","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

I feel so much better now, but want to be transparent, do I tell my PI what's going on?\nFirst, it feels weird calling it a miscarriage because my husband and I are not trying to get pregnant, I have a hormonal arm implant (Nexplanon) and am in no way ready to start a family nor am sure that's something I will ever want.  I have told my mum, and a few close friends, but haven't really referred it as a miscarriage because that implies a loss.  I am so unbelievably relieved and can focus for the first time in over 3 months.  My doctor and my counselor are great allies and have been so supportive while pushing beyond me saying this is \"just a normal grad school mental breakdown\". I had an IUD before the arm implant and had not had a period in 5 years, so we never considered I could be pregnant and I assumed I had gained a little weight from stress eating.  Lo and behold, there is a 1\/100 chance of getting pregnant with the Nexplanon arm implant, but most likely to be unviable and ectopic so there was a chance I needed a D&amp;C which was very stressful and upsetting while busy with conference prep and international travel.  I am emotionally exhausted and did become heavily reliant on Zopiclone to sleep when I was having frequent anxiety attacks.  Now that I am feeling pretty emotionally good and weaning off the Zopiclone, I am not sleeping nearly as well without it, but on my way to feeling like myself again.  I'm still not 100%, and would want to acknowledge that something has been off about me if my PI does bring it up (which he has in the past when I've been noticeably down - I'm often described as an effervescent and vivacious person and have no poker face).  Also I am still mildly traumatized from seeing the...expelled tissue...and often can't shake the image from my head and that has not helped my sleeping situation.  When I write it all out, it sounds very dramatic and serious.  \n   \nOn one hand, I am mentally at ease after months of uncontrollable crying, lack of focus, and intense, disruptive physical anxiety.  I was still able to do my project management job well but I had to make some big changes about my thesis and got kind of paralyzed in my own research. I don't want to diminish that my academic life is still really stressful: I work full-time as a project manager and my PI is also my MA supervisor so we see each other several times a week.  He knows me well. We have a good relationship and he is very supportive of me as a human, a researcher, and a professional in my field from before going back to school.  He is a very nurturing supervisor and has been supportive during other losses I have experienced in our time working closely together.  On the other hand, I don't know if it's better to leave it at \"I've had an ongoing medical challenge but am feeling a lot better, looking forward to the holiday break and returning refreshed\".  There is such a taboo about discussing women's reproductive health so it would be easier to talk about if it was strictly a mental health issue - it feels so heavy and complicated, especially with holiday parties and everyone asking \"how are you?!?!?\" when I'm not great.\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.  I know other women who struggle with the dichotomy of academia vs family and work-life balance.  I feel quite alone in this as many of my friends are starting to get baby fever or actively trying to get pregnant.","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

But I don\u2019t see a reason in sitting here learning material and putting in endless hours into something that provides me with almost nothing in return or the only good return being the discovery of something I hate. I go to a fairly cheap community college and financial aid eliminates about half of my overall 2 year tuition which is only 5,600 before aid. My parents keep telling me I\u2019m just lazy, that I dont actually want to do anything except smoke weed and hang out with my girlfriend. Whenever i bring up the idea of a trade or anything else i\u2019m immediately told i\u2019m not cut out for it and that my best option is to sit here and suffer for the next 100 days.

I would love to use this summer as a break before my rigorous grad program that runs all year long for about 3 years, but I also feel guilty about the idea of not having a summer job (I'd get an internship but jfc there are none in my area that will allow anyone who isn't already a grad student in, plus my program will put me into an intership position anyways). My family keeps telling me that they're glad I'll finally have a break but I'm worried about being dead weight, have any of you been in this position before? Am I being overdramatic in one way or another? This might just be the finals stress rotting my brain but I really can't stop worrying about it. Any advice is appreciated :)","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

I just started the fall semester and I'm drowning.\n\nLast year I had a decent amount of homework but I never had trouble getting it turned in on time. And I had plenty of time to see my friends, relax, eat, and work on personal projects that interest me. This semester has been different. I have 3+ assignments due every single day, I'm in two art studios that are only worth three credits each, but you have to be in for six hours every week. I've had assignments I had to turn in incomplete because I ran out of time. And it's not for lack of trying, I'm doing homework literally every free second I get between class, meals, and sleep. I don't get enough sleep, I don't eat enough, and I have exactly zero time for personal creative endeavors.\n\nI'm exhausted all the time, I have days where my anxiety gets so bad I burst into tears just from stress, and yet I haven't been able to slow down even a bit. It's this, or drop out. The only way out is through.\n\nI'm writing this post as I wait for my computer to update so that I can finish a writing assignment and a quiz that are both due tonight, and I have some art project stuff that's due in class tomorrow, which means it needs to get done tonight. I'll probably be up late trying to finish it which means I won't get enough sleep again. Tomorrow evening I need to start working on an essay that's due Friday (it's currently Wednesday), and I also have a workbook page due that day. And it doesn't get any better after that. Every class has loaded me down with more assignments than is even remotely reasonable, and I'm only taking four classes because I had to drop one. I was originally taking five, but it quickly became apparent it literally was not going to be possible to complete all five of them and balance all the work. But I'm starting to get worried even four is going to be too much with the ungodly amount of work these professors assign. My dishes have piled high, my laundry has been sitting in my corner unfolded for days, I desperately need a shower, and I have online job training I need to complete at some point. I haven't had even a second to spare for any of it because every second has been dedicated to homework. If I do get a second to breath, I'm so desperate to finally relax and get even a moment to not be working that I cannot summon the will to do chores.\n\nI know that the way I'm living right now is not healthy, but what's the alternative? Stop turning in assignments and fail my classes? Drop out of school? Neither of those are possible for me. As stressful as it is, I love school and one hard semester would never be enough to make me accept failure.\n\nYou might suggest I drop another class, but that's not an option either. If I go down to three classes I'll become a part-time student which means I would lose my scholarship. And I can't afford college without it.\n\nThere's really not much I can do other than tough it out, I just desperately needed to complain about my situation somewhere. It's been weighing on me for awhile. I would go to therapy, but I don't have time. I've had to postpone doctor's appointments of all kinds, I haven't been able to hangout with friends unless it's study session, and I haven't been able to work on my book that I'm writing or make any new art without sacrificing homework time that invariably ends up hitting my grade in that class. It's currently week 6 of 16 at my university, plus finals week. So I'm not even halfway done and I'm already crippled by how much work I have, and it's not going to slow down anytime soon.\n\nThis just really, truly sucks.","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

Well, it took my dad a long time to get approved so I thought that once he got approved I could apply to a college and then start getting money pretty quick. Apparently thats not how it works, my dad has to get processed too. Now because no one told me that, (only how he had been accepted after waiting like a year or two already) and I was being pressured to start college for other reasons, I started looking at potential colleges. My grandmother found a pretty nice one and texted me one day to come over to her house and we would look at the school and see how we like it. Well when I got there she already had all the information typed out on the application form for a degree I never wanted in the first place. If it were up to me, I wouldn't have even gone to school in the first place. But it wasn't, I knew how much it meant to my other grandmother (I will be referring to her as Nana). I had already decided that with the \"free money\" (I say that very lightly lol) and my Nanas eagerness for me to start school, that I would do it, I just wanted to wait a little bit. Well, I thought I had mentioned my unwillingness enough times to stick. I already have a few job offers I could take for the summer this year if I really wanted to. Anyway, I asked my grandmother if I had to do this. She told me I had too. So obviously I thought her and Nana had talked it out and they determined I had to start right away, which was the only reason why I caved in. So I accepted and she called Nana and they paid. When I got home that night, my Nana and Dada (primary caregivers\/parental figures) asked me if this is what I wanted. I told them this: \"No, but it's something I have to do\" referring back to what my grandmother had said previously. Well, here I am a few days later and I just now got off the phone with my Nana who told me she had no idea and that she was never gonna force me to go to college, as well as it would take until the end of the year most likely before I would receive the ssdi benefits and none of which would include money I would have made if I was getting paid as soon as I started school. So now I'm at a crossroads, I never wanted to start school in the first place because I was scared I would give up halfway through or change my mind and switch majors. I wanted to wait and plan everything out and not jump right in. I jumped right into work right after high school and worked myself sick, I didn't wanna repeat that. Tomorrow i think, is the deadline to ask for our money back. I don't wanna be labeled a college dropout. The mere thought of it makes me want to cry tbh. I know that this is mostly my fault for not checking in with both parties. Most of the time they do consult each other about my school so I just assumed they both knew everything. Now I have no idea what to do, I have less than 24 hours to figure out if I drop out and get the money back, or switch majors which will still leave me with the same issue because I have no idea what I want to do. I'm open to hear what literally anyone has to say.","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}

Any advice?\nI am absolutely terrified to graduate simply because of only having six months to find a job and establish myself before starting repayment. I know federal loans can be based on income, but I also have a huge private loan because of an error with my university\u2019s financial aid office ($30k). I\u2019m going to be graduating with a not so useful environmental biology\/zoology degree. The reason why I felt secure in this degree is because I absolutely do plan to go for my Master\u2019s, but I\u2019d really like to take a yearlong break. On top of this, I plan to move out of state (permanently) to attend school for my Master\u2019s since there\u2019s a ton of universities in the state with great programs, and also because this state has way more job opportunities for my degree. A ton more than my home state. \n\nI\u2019m in my early 20s and I feel like I should have learned how to be an adult by now but I feel everything I\u2019m talking about and my expectations for my future may be immature and naive. Reality is probably going to hit me like a truck.","is_completed":true,"current_phase":"terminating"}
