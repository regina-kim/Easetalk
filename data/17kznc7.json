  "concern": "Hi,\n\nYesterday I opened up my computer and saw that I received an extremely low score(15.5/100, the average  score was 60)in a programming midterm exam. To be fair, that was my fault as I did not balance my time well and spent too much time on more difficult assessments instead of going through exam content. It is a second year course too. I got frustrated and upset. In the beginning, I thought about just keeping quiet and not bursting out but then a few minutes I couldn't take it so I told my parents. Then, I cried in my room really terribly to the point that everyone can hear. This made my Father stressed and he got extremely angry about the fact and told me he won't speak to me for one week to make me learn that parents have their own issues too and cannot get stressed about adult children (Tbh, I have complained to him and expressed frustration immaturely a lot of times over the past year about my low scores and low GPA). That is my fault and I do not know how to cope. I feel angry back towards my Father but those feelings of anger do not make sense when I was wrong here.\n\n Honestly, complaining to them has been a coping mechanism for me and I do not know any other way to react to such low results other than being emotional about it. I have too much stress over this issue and that I have to at least pass this course.\n\nAlso, how do I stop hanging on so tightly to grades. But I know that acquiring the right skillet is more important. How do I detach from the feelings and mindset that good grades==Good Life?",
