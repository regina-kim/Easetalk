  "concern": "I have never been in an academic setting that challenged me so much. In undergrad I was always on top of my work and had enough time to enjoy myself, go to the gym, and even party. In my second year of my PhD program all I do is work and on the weekends I usually sleep or go out somewhere just to try to enjoy myself. Now that the semester has begun I lost my Sundays to a full day of class work. I am so lucky to do what I love, but I love it a lot less when I am being overworked. It does not help that my PI is an absolute workaholic. How do people not burn out working 6 days a week with such mentally involved tasks?",
