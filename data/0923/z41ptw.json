And if any of you have transferred what helped you decide that was the best decision? How do you know if transferring is the best option? I’m just scared if I transfer I will still be miserable, I also am not sure where to transfer I’ve looked into osu but I’m scared it’ll just be the same. I just need help overall haha",
