What do I do?\nI’ll admit, much of this is my fault. Mental health should never be an excuse for apathy, and this is a lesson that kept fucking me over through the years. \n\nBut here I am now, failing two major exams(one where I got the lowest score in the class) and feeling complete apathy towards everything. It’s so maddening that I’ve even allowed it happen, allowed yet another opportunity slip away due to allowing my poor mental health to completely control me. \n\nAnxiety, depression, etc. are all so bad at the moment. I don’t really know the root cause of it. It just came a couple months ago and has completely taken my over since.\n\nWhat should I do? I really feel lost. Can I even recover from this and save my grades for the semester? I know it sounds foolish asking strangers on the internet for advice, but I simply don’t know what to do and need quick advice on how to turn things around.",
