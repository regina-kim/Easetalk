Need Help!\nFor those of us studying to get a BFA (Bachelor of Fine Arts) degree or those of you who already have one I initially started studying Theater Arts to get a BFA because I read up on it and wanted to do theater and teach it someday. Do I need to be studying something else to teach it or can I just get a BFA, and take a teaching program after? I also need some help on deciding on what I should study mainly because all my life I've loved singing, and as I got older I realized that I love theater and how I always loved performing at home for no one, but as of today my mom brought up the point that I maybe don't like acting just singing because I'm not as good or I don't know if I'm as good as acting, but I can remember when I was little trying to recreate scenes from T.V. and wanting to sing and dance like the people in the movies and wanting a role that would challenge me emotionally and I would put all I have into it but I'm stumped so I'm not sure if maybe I should change my major because maybe just maybe I'm not good at acting I don't know.",
