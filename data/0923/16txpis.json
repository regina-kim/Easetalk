  "concern": "title: Graduating soon and worried about repaying loans. Any advice?\nI am absolutely terrified to graduate simply because of only having six months to find a job and establish myself before starting repayment. I know federal loans can be based on income, but I also have a huge private loan because of an error with my university’s financial aid office ($30k). I’m going to be graduating with a not so useful environmental biology/zoology degree. The reason why I felt secure in this degree is because I absolutely do plan to go for my Master’s, but I’d really like to take a yearlong break. On top of this, I plan to move out of state (permanently) to attend school for my Master’s since there’s a ton of universities in the state with great programs, and also because this state has way more job opportunities for my degree. A ton more than my home state. \n\nI’m in my early 20s and I feel like I should have learned how to be an adult by now but I feel everything I’m talking about and my expectations for my future may be immature and naive. Reality is probably going to hit me like a truck.",
