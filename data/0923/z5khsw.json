I didn’t do a paper that was due because of work and there is hw that is due today, that idk if I’ll finish that because I had a lot going on this week and I’m at work currently. I’m debating weather to just drop the class or keep going and see how it goes. I just feel that because I already had a rough start to the class, I feel discouraged :/ what should I do?",
