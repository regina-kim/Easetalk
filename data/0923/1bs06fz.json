  "concern": "title: Is it a bad idea to major in something you kind of suck at but still passionate about?\nI'm a grade 12 who is going to be graduating high school in June. I'll be starting university in September, majoring in economics. But I am doubting myself a bit mainly because out of the seven courses I've taken in grade 12, it looks like my lowest grade will be economics. My grades range from 90-95%, with economics being the 90%. The median grade for my economics class was 90%, hence I performed average relative to my peers.\n\nThe thing is, is I studied so much for that class, did all the textbook questions, took notes, etc. because I am passionate about the subject. I can not imagine studying anything else. Despite this, I still finished average in my class. Perhaps because some concepts (e.g. graphs pertaining to competitiion theory like monopolies, oligopolies, etc.) didn't \"come naturally\" to me.\n\nMeanwhile, there were people in that class who are not even going into econ like I am, and are pursuing careers like engineering and computer science, and they took economics because according to them, it's an \"easy course\". Some of those people barely attended class, were disruptive during the lessons, yet got 95+ because according to them, all the concepts came naturally to them and therefore they barely had to study or do practice questions in order to succeed.\n\nSo yeah, after my performance in grade 12 economics, I've been constantly questioning whether or not this is the right major for me. But even though I'm bad at it, I'm still passionate about it. I've read *Capitalism and Freedom* and *The Wealth of Nations* in my spare time because I'm truly interested in economics. Everyday, I spend time reading news relevant to the ongoing cost of living crisis, rising inflation, rising interest rates, etc. Yet I performed so badly in that class.\n\nIf there are people who are able to effortlessly score 95+ and treat economics as an \"easy course\", but I barely scored a 90 while taking economics seriously, how on earth am I going to succeed as an economics major?\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is this still the right major for me?",
