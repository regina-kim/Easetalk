  "concern": "title: Is it a bad idea to write about my previous drug problem for a narrative essay in my english class? (USA community college)\nNow that I'm a freshman in college I'm not really sure what I can and cannot get away with topic-wise.\n\nIt'd be about my struggle with using weed (so no hard drugs) as a coping mechanism, trying to fill a void in my life, and how I turned it into something good (still in the process of that 'good' actually, which is why I have more to write about regarding the drug problem).\n\nThe essays will be reviewed by my classmates but it's an online class and I don't know any of them so I'm not sure if that will raise the stakes at all. Everyone else so far has written some pretty personal/sad/TMI stuff but nothing drug-related.\n\nEdit: And no, I don't really have much else to write about. I feel like this would make more of an entertaining story since I have some particular ridiculous 'moments' in mind.\n\nEdit 2: And yeah I know I could ask my prof but this is kinda last minute (chronic procrastinator) so....\n\n**Edit: Thank you everyone for being kind, helpful and non-judgemental. I've found a completely different (far more appropriate) story to write about which I'm equally passionate for. I think I'll create an anonymous blog site someday, and I can post this drug-related story on there instead.**",
