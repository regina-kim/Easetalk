  "concern": "title: how did you guys choose your major?\nso apparently, I finished my exams and got 84%. in my country, applying to universities depends on the mark you get. apparently I really don't know what should I do. I don't like med school so we leave this option behind. I'm interested in engineering, literally any engineering field but specifically rn I have mechatronics engineering in mind. my parents on the other hand don't really support my decision about engineering. universities are completely free, except for the private universities of course. my parents want to get me into a private university but tbh my family is not that financially stable and my parents already have plans of moving out of our apartment, get a house and a new car. I really don't want to trouble them with my uni fees especially that they've spent 7000$ on my tuitions and school stuff. my boyfriend is saying that this is an opportunity that I shouldn't miss but he doesn't get it, his family is rich and they plan on sending him to study medicine in another country so he doesn't understand why I feel so guilty. my mom said I should study English and since I'm already good at it I won't have much trouble. to me, I'm flexible, I don't mind studying anything but it's still a hard decision to make\n\nedit: I really didn't think anyone would notice this post but I need to thank you all. I read every single comment and they're all so helpful. the reason I don't have a major in my mind is because I'm good at any subject in hand and maybe, just maybe because my parents always decided everything on my behalf lol. My parents are against engineering is because they believe I'm a lazy one and won't be able to put up with how hard it is all because of my high school grades (apparently i have adhd and depression but im off meds which affected my grades). I know there's nothing like an easy major and that's what I've been trying to tell them but yeah. my mother only suggested studying English so I could be an English teacher. i mentioned that in my country we can apply to universities depending on our marks, the less you get the less options you have. also studying in another country or in another city in my country is not an option lol. again, thanks a lot for your help",
