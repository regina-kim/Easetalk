They've identified a specific next step—attending a campus event or joining a club—and demonstrated moderate confidence (rated 5) in taking action. Change Talk is present, and sustain talk has decreased, indicating readiness to move forward. The next phase should focus on developing an action plan to overcome these barriers.
