  "concern": "title: Professors who let students pick their own groups, why?\nI hear that the purpose of group work is about learning to work with others but doesn't choosing your own groups go against it? In 2023 most students don't come to class that often bc you can easily work from home with all the materials on the internet/ recorded lectures/ slides. Most who \"work\" from home are \"slackers\", but a big amount of us have found that working from home mostly suits us better. I love my life both personal and academical rn. UNTIL CHOOSE YOUR OWN groups COME. Then I get anxious 4 a week trying to run to those I kinda was friends with but I usually end up in the same group as slackers who never show up at school nor do school from home until the day before or never. If professors chose our groups I feel like it will be evened out. So just wanna know the reason y some proffesors don't bother?",
