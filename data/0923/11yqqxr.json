It's understandable that the temptation to ignore the alarm might arise, especially when you're deeply focused.

Another idea might be to pair the break with something enjoyable, such as a quick walk or a favorite song, to make the pause feel rewarding. You've identified a solid starting point, and I'm here to support you as you navigate these changes. Let's touch base next time to see how this approach is working and adapt if necessary.

I usually get 8 hours of sleep but now I wake up after like 5 hours of sleep super alert and tired at the same time.\n\nI study for long hours not even knowing the time has passed. I get shivers and random boost of energy and heart pace increase through out the day. I haven't drank coffee for more than a year.\n\nI go without feeling hungry for a long time. And this may sound weird but I don't even feel horny anymore. And at night I won't sleep until like 3 am because I have so much energy, but if I try to get up and something I can't\n\nThis has been going on for like a week now. And it just gets worse and worse as The days go on and I see how much work I have to do. I also get in like a dream like state and sort of zone out.",
