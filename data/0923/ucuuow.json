I had a meeting today and they told me I was on the verge of getting kicked out because I was sick(physically and mentally) a lot in the middle of the semester so I didn’t go to class. There’s three weeks left and I was wondering how it would affect my GPA and would it ruin my chances of getting into a community college. I had around a 2.0 last semester because I just didn’t try hard. \n\nNote: I just got on anti-depressants and my parents want me to go see if I have ADD or ADHD. not sure if that plays into anything but yeah.",
