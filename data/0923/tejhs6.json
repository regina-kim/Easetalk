I thought i could handle taking 2 classes with a toddler &amp; newborn, but god was I totally wrong. I emailed my professors &amp; told them that I just gave birth &amp; they told me &amp; I can turn in my work whenever with no penalties. I’m so in between on if I should withdraw from this semester, or if I should continue with the classes. It’s just so fucking hard being a stay at home mom with a toddler &amp; newborn + being a college student. I feel like a failure if I withdraw and I hate it. Any other moms who just had a baby &amp; are still taking classes? How are you handling it?",
