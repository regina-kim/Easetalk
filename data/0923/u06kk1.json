  "concern": "title: Graduate Community College in Fall 2022 or Spring 2023\nOk this one's a hard decision. I need 17 more credits to graduate with my 2-year degree before I go on for a bachelor's in either Journalism or Communications. I love the community college i'm in and i've made incredible friends which many will still be around with next year plus i'm still very young at 19 and want to enjoy every moment of my youth in college but at the same time, I want to go to a college in NYC and most of those who graduated with me in high school in 2020 and went to a 2-year college would be in their transfer year before graduating. In order to graduate in the fall, I need to take 6 classes to get the credits I need. I can do that, finish up faster, and get to NYC where I want to be for my last 2 years of school or take 4 and then stay another semester, take 4 (while taking advantage of financial aid) and graduate while having more personal time and less stress from classes and still make it to NYC in Fall 2023. Help me on which would be best pls.",
