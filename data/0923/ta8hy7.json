I feel like life is already over because I messed up the timeline so badly.\n\nMy interests kind of lean towards writing, design, journalism, and social media management type things but would they even want me by the time I’m finished with school? Because of what my age will be compared to other people applying for the jobs?\n\nAny advice is appreciated and any tips to graduate fast are too",
