  "concern": "title: Rejection from grad school\nHi thanks for taking the time to read this, I'll make it brief.\n\nI just graduated college and I applied to graduate school for that same program. Well, I was denied. This came as a complete shock to me, as I have never really been rejected from anything in life. Not to say I always get want I want, but whenever I set out to do something, I get it. So this was big.\n\nI emailed the MS program director as well as other professors in the program asking what I could do better. I got responses like \"it's competitive\" or \"a higher gpa is usually the case\" (even though I was above average) and things like people had more research experience in their undergrad. I want to apply again. I can't change my grades but I can change my resume, educational personal statement, my writing examples and my references.\n\nI am trying to keep an open mind but I feel defeated. I was applying for the fall now I need to wait until the spring semester and even then, I don't know if ill be accepted. I really have come at a crossroads in my life but I am taking it as an opportunity to learn. I feel pretty sad and rejected and unsure about the immediate future. I am going to gun for this though and try for spring.\n\nI want this so bad and I have told them this. Any advice?",
