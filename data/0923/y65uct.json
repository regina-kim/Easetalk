This isn’t to brag, I’m not that smart, but I am diligent. It’s more like most of my classes are online and most of those are evaluated based on coursework and final “reports” rather than exams, which makes it very easy to get very good grades for me, since I don’t actually have to study at all, except for the week I’m writing the report.\n\nI have literally not had a single in person exam since I got into uni, and even courses where I barely understand anything I get an A or A+ on. I’m in CS, and I was expecting to learn some actually useful skills. Now I’m in 3rd year, supposed to be looking for jobs and internships, but feel woefully unprepared for anything. Literally feels like I haven’t learned a single useful thing since high school. We did have some programming courses, but the most complex thing they had us build is an angry birds clone in Java. \n\nI’ve started to learn HTML/CSS on my own time just so I can have SOME form of marketable skill, but I’m always worrying about my future. Idk if I’ll find a job at this rate. This is supposed to be a top 10 school in Japan too….",
