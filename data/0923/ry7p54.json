There is a mutual understanding of the client's sense of being 'on the outside' and their desire to make connections.

  "concern": "title: Having no friends\nI started college a couple of months ago, and I moved from a different country so i had to leave all my friends that i had. I've never had any issues with making friends, I think at the beginning of starting a new school I've always been worried about making friends but it just... happened. But after a few days i realized that i hadn't made any, there are not many people in my class ( around 10) , and a lot of them aren't even around my age, i'd say there are about 2 kids my age, but they are shy and have never spoken to me. There was no introduction day so I never got introduced to anyone, and im worried sick i won't make any friends. I've started to become really lonely, at break times i just go out and sit alone. I honestly was just not expecting college to be that much different from highschool, but it seems everyone has already made their friends and im srewed. My college isn't very good either, no clubs, no events, really just nothing. I feel like im wasting some really important years of my life sitting at home doing nothing when i should be out with friends. im not sure what to do.",
