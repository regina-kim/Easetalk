  "concern": "title: Professor Left The Most Vague Feedback on Canvas\nSo, I’m in an online personal finance class as one of my courses in my college. I’m not doing the best, as I needed DSPS accommodations (I have anxiety and ADHD), but I didn’t get accepted until just the other day (90% of the way through the semester), and my meeting for choosing said accommodations wasn’t until yesterday. I just sent out the letters earlier today. I am sitting at a C- in the class right now, as a quiz I did got me just above a 70%. We submit assignments through canvas, and occasionally she leaves feedback. \n\n\nToday I checked my grades and saw I got a 40/50 on the quiz. Along with this grade was a feedback message. I click on it, and all it says is “see me.” and nothing else. I got confused and emailed her, and I’m waiting to see what she wants to talk about, but it’s making my anxiety go through the roof. I’m hoping she will see my letter and be more understanding because I admit I haven’t done the best in her class. There were a few assignments I didn’t turn in because they were really confusing and stressed me out. This professor seems to be all business and very strict, and I’m honestly a little intimidated by her.",
