I can leave it but my advisor thinks I should stay so that I stand out. I don’t usually quit things but my anxiety is so high.\n\nI have a project that’s due for the program very soon. I have terribly managed my time regarding it, while dealing with personal issues throughout the semester on top of my other course assignments. I’m thinking about just not turning anything in  and leaving regardless of what others want me to do but I’m scared.\n\nWhat would you guys do?\n\np.s.
