  "concern": "title: How do I get through grad school?\nPretty sure there are several posts similar to mine, but I don't know who to ask for advice. I naively joined a master's program in computer science this September, simply because I felt like my undergraduate degree taught me nothing and i want to learn the concepts in a better institution. One month in and I am barely holding back my tears. I know it wasn't going to be easy but I took a subject called mathematical foundations, and I am absolutely unable to comprehend it. The other 2 subjects i took are definitely hard but i feel like with an extreme amount of effort, i can do my best and learn well. But with math foundations, i don't know what to do. I don't know how the rest of my classmates feel about the subject, but i do know that one friend is finding it quite easy. I have spent several hours going through the basics of linear algebra and it still doesn't change the fact that i am not able to comprehend the subject. I'm not saying I've given up, but i want to ask if this is a natural feeling that some of you all may have felt for some subjects. How did you get through this, and 4 semesters of this? Can you provide some tips on how to manage the semester, especially if you've considered yourself an average/below average student?",
