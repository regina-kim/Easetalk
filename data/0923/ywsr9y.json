The therapist has shown empathy, understanding, and summarized the client's feelings and concerns effectively. This has helped build rapport and clarified the client's situation. Thus, the goals of the Exploring phase are met, allowing a transition to Guiding to strengthen motivation and evoke Change Talk. The use of open questions and reflections supported the client's narrative. In Guiding, focus on discussing the importance of self-care and strategies to communicate effectively with their parents.",
