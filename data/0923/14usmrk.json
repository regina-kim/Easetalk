  "concern": "title: Should I drop out of my Summer class?\nI (20f) only have to do one more math class to get my general 2 year degree, however all the summer classes at my community college are only online for summer quarter. Math is my worst subject so this is very alarming, but I signed up for one online however I'm finding it extremely difficult to grasp the concepts through videos, and typing my answers is extremely stressful. There are a lot of really good in person classes for the fall, but my parents are really looking forward to me graduating by the end of Summer.\n\nMy goal is to be hired and go to the police academy by fall and be graduated by August. I don't need a degree to be hired, but it would look better on my application and possibly give me a small pay boost if I'm hired. I really don't want to disappoint my family, but at the same time I'm very concerned and don't want to end up failing. I also need to build muscle for the physical test, but I haven't had the time due to work and classes. I've never been good at online classes (my grades were the worst during the pandemic) and the tutors at my college seem very busy when I go there. What's the right thing to do?\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much. I'm going to try and power through it. :)",
