I’m currently in Turkey on vacation with my parents but I need to decide what I want to do so I can make it to the fall term. \n\nI started my computer science major online in 2020 in a university for one year, than switched to a different university for applied computer science for another year first semester online, second in person. I’m going into my third year after the summer and I barely have any knowledge of the subject I’m doing. I’ve had a difficult time learning online and learning computer science in general. \n\nI did some thinking and the only reason I want to switch is because I find computer science hard, which I don’t think is a valid reason for me, and it’s only going to get harder as I’m closing in on the major. I can’t decide if I want to switch to business or not. People say that business is useless and a waste of money, while computer science is the future and has well paying jobs. \n\nI’m so lost at what I’m supposed to be doing and it’s so stressful. I’d kindly appreciate any kind of input.",
