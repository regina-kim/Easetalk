  "concern": "title: Advice on SAP appeal in context of TWO appeals and previous appeals?\nHo boy\n\nI am in trouble. I'm probably a terrible student at best of times and throw in some shitty life events that JUST GOT WORSE during covid and those downstream events, I'm sitting here writing my 3rd SAP appeal for Spring 2022 due tomorrow, and IF it gets approved, I will be writing another one for Summer 2022. My housing depends on it, so that is not good. And if my appeal doesn't go through I will also owe the college unpaid tuition and housing for 2022.  \n\n\nYEAH I KNOW. Its so bad. It just took me a while to figure out who to talk to when I realized things were off the rails and by the time it got to Financial aid advisor, she was pissed (I don't blame her, and I have worked with her before, she's great), and we only have a couple days.  \n\n\nWorking backwards. Fall 2020 was super fucked up. Had adhd medication problem and had to try and fail on different medication. Couldn't pay rent, and landlords turned off heat to force eviction and or/payment (didn't care about eviction protection and refused to fill out assistance paperwork), dealt with that but it wasn't pretty. And then I got covid and was dead sick for 3 weeks. Basically gave up on school and tbh, almost life. \n\n  \nFast forward, skipped Spring 2021, and enrolled again fall 2021 as I got covid rent assistance so felt I could. But it also kinda fell together last minute and I didn't have financial aid together yet (actually enrolling after start of classes) In the process of getting caught up, my landlords ended tenancy even though they had additional months rent (2) so had to move. Once moved, used the issues with rent and landlord on that SAP appeal for fall 2021 with the resolution being getting into university housing.   \n\n\nGREAT! Appeal when through, got aid towards end of semester.   \n\n\n**SPRING 2022 Appeal reason For Fall 2021 incomplete** Not great. I was super behind in my in person dance class because I missed a bunch. We made a plan to get me caught up if I attended the rest of the classes and the other students helped me get caught up for the final group dance project. One class later, the professor gets covid, cancels the rest of the classes and tells everyone to do a much abbreviated project. But now I have a lot more to figure out on own. Still seems doable, I have video of the last day we met and what the the dance routine was. I'm lost, but its doable. But I ask for more time given I'll have to figure out on my own. He agrees. Then a few days later, my grandmother dies, and I had to ask for another extension (and I felt like he was going to think I was lying at that point, but it happened). At some point, I'm getting back to trying to get the final project done, and I am just lost. But I'm trying, my tooth breaks from clenching my jaw and I just kinda stop, decide I'll figure out what to do next later \n\nBut, as you can guess from my user name, never did. Start spring 2022, I now have an incomplete and no financial aid. I dunno if I am going to appeal or if the instructor will allow me to turn in. \"I'll figure that out in a few days, I say.\" I didn't. Because I got my aid so late, I just used the refund to pay for a lot of what I needed for second semester. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summer 2022 Appeal Reason for Spring 2022** A couple weeks into 2nd semester, I'm floundering. I haven't figured out what to do about aid and late dance class final and instead of dealing with it, I just kinda.. gave up. Got myself into the university counseling center, they started me on antidepressant, once I got out of the worst of it, I was just racing to catch up on school work. Which I didn't get caught up fully when I realized I needed help and was in WAY over my head. But by the time I kinda got to talking to the right people, it's basically the end of the semester AND HERE WE ARE NOW. I am going to have to take an incomplete on another class, and another I have to argue and beg with professor to allow makeup work for missed in class activities. He agrees and I should pass (know material, aced two prior tests, so I'm current on the information, just not the work. Exam at end of week) On top of that, the mental health care provider thought my adhd might be slight be undermedicated, and she suggested that we increase the dose, but that has turned into a mess, with problems with the insurance (she wanted to use two different types of pills, a XR IR combo), with confusion at the pharmacy, with delays in the prior auth and with the school not having escript capabilities for adderall, and then a medication shortage, so I have to call around and find one that has brand adderall in stock, plus she is work from home right now due to some office construction on campus this week, so I'm literally waiting for a paper script in the mail. Almost a month since that started we've been dealing with the adderall problem and its not resolved so I'm working non-medicated and spending way too much time dealing with that.  \n\n\n**Right now, I am working on and need to finish my Spring 2022 SAP appeal tonight for 10am tomorrow.** I am writing it out now, the financial aid advisor said I should keep it to being about my grandmothers death and my instructor getting covid and canceling classes, thus changing the plan that was supposed to help address the missed course work. I am not supposed to use the broken tooth because it's still broken and even though I am enrolled at the dental school near me, its been a slow process getting that underway and I'll have to do god knows what to pay for the crown. So my financial aid advisor said not to include it because it's not resolved.\n\nI would really love some advice/insight. I need this, really need this and I've been working on it since this afternoon, trying to write out the series of events but feel like I'm either over or under-explaining. I'm also stuck in what is the resolution to my grandmothers death? If I say its the depression that I had treated now, then I won't be able to use for the next appeal.",
