  "concern": "title: Help me decide on a lab!\nSo I have two labs, A and B. Our program (bio) makes us rotate prior to choosing our thesis lab. \nI’m really, really passionate about A’s research. A is a really good lab, PI has tons of funding, great connections, great facility, awards, etc. I rotated with A, told me to go rotate with C as well since they collaborate on the project I want to join. A is also really competitive to get into, so I agreed to rotate with C in a few weeks, even though it’s an engineering lab which I’m not into at ALL, but thought maybe it’ll help me understand A’s research better. Now I learn that if I join I might need to do a comentoring situation with both A and C which I’m really not into since I don’t want to get into biomedical engineering. Theoretically I could ask to stay solely in A if I don’t end up liking C when I rotate, but I’m not sure if that’ll seem odd since I agreed to rotating with C and if it will lower my chances of getting into A. Also, I’m not really a fan of the lab environment in A, it hasn’t been super welcoming from the other grad students, but the PI is a good mentor. I won’t get a lot of guidance since she wants independence, but I feel like it will be hard but make me a “better scientist.” Also, the PI will be retiring when the grant that I’m joining will finish, so theoretically we would be leaving at the same time, which I’m not sure if that’s a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, B is a good lab, has a great lab culture, I enjoy the methods used, really sweet PI that I feel comfortable asking questions to. BUT I’m not into the overall research topic at all, and really don’t want to be stuck in that field, and when I think about research I’m SO much more into A’s research. \n\nTLDR: Which lab should I join? The lab that checks all the boxes but I don’t like the research, or the one I really like the research, but has a lot of other problems",
