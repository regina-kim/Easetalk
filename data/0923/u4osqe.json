  "concern": "title: Advice - PI Preventing Me From Changing Labs\nHi all! So I've been trying to change labs for a bit now. My relationship with my advisor has gone from bad to worse and the relationship can no longer be salvaged. For the past few months, my PI has repeated refused to support any accomplishment or research venture I had. The PI doesn't even fund any part of my PhD as I am a fellow in a dry lab with no resource costs. Even my conferences, poster printing, and publications I've had to pay for out of pocket. \n\nRecently, I began speaking to a new PI in my department about changing to their lab. They were initially supportive of it but just wanted to make sure things were cool with my current PI before I changed. I let my current PI know I was planning on changing labs and made the commitments to finish up all the pending work on a paper I was working on with them as a corresponding before leaving the lab. The current PI said they understood and supported the move. This was surprising but didn't think anything else of it. A few days past and now the new PI has pulled back their support after speaking to my current PI. I spoke to my current PI today and they sounded pleased with themselves regarding me not being able to leave. They gave me an ultimatum which drastically limits my dissertation if I wanted to stay in their lab after all of this. I'm sure the current PI (who is know for being petty and spiteful) meddled and prevented my change from going through. \n\nThe lab I was hoping to change into is the closest to what I'd like to do for my PhD at my school. My current PI has essentially put me being a rock and a hard place, making me chose between either continuing under them with major re-shifting of my dissertation, or leaving the program entirely. I don't know how I can possibly salvage the relationship with the other PI I wanted to change to in the hopes of changing to them still. It feels like I'm a prisoner of my PI. Any advice?",
