  "concern": "title: Should I transfer halfway through college\nThis has been a thought that keeps popping into my head and I want to know what others think.\n\nI’m currently a sophomore at a large (hard to get into / very “good”) public university. Engineering major with a minor, consulting/big tech company/a less technical job that makes good money is the goal.\n\nI’m someone who never would have thought i’d ever consider something like this, in no way am I seeking “the college experience” or anything like that, to start. I see the (fun) social aspect of college to be quite superficial, and in no way is that playing into this idea. All of this in centered around being successful / not failing life. \n\nA little background for how college has been so far:\nI’m not doing great and I have nothing going for me / to assure me i’m going to do well at all. GPA is currently at a 3.4 calculated before this semester ends (don’t expect it to hurt it much more but it def won’t get better). In terms of classes, I feel as though i’m doing poorly, even at the things that shouldn’t be too difficult, and I feel as though i’m in a huge academic hole. I don’t see how much grades could really improve. Extracurriculars: none. I gave it my all in applying to professional clubs that would have very much helped my ass but I was never accepted, and that was when I didn’t look like a dumbass in comparison to my competition (a lot of people). Professional experience: I’ve had a couple stupid summer jobs but nothing ever remotely relating to my major or area or interest i.e. working at a restaurant. so none. social/networking: none. I have an extremely limited social circle, messed up and got “stuck” with a lot of higschool friends, have no connections to any job/internship/good club prospect and my parents/family have no such connections either. I can talk to people and make a good impression, but i’m bad at “putting myself out there”. \n\nMy concerns for my situation:\nI need to be good at something (grades, knowing people, etc) but none of that is going well and I don’t see how I could improve it. I’m ambitious and to get to where I want to be in my adult life I need to be good at something. when it comes to a job or an internship or any future prospect I don’t see why anyone would ever pick me, I know I wouldn’t.\n\nI used to be extremely successful with everything I did. I had very very good grades at a well renowned private high school and got into many very good universities (didn’t attend because of money and I thought this “made sense”). I was on par or better than all the peers I can’t remotely compare myself to now (at the same college where they are doing just fine). I am extremely unhappy with my life now. I don’t do anything fun, I just work. My university is very work hard play hard, but all I do is work without success. I hate that I see zero indication of being the person I want to be in terms of success. making money matters to me. my parents worked their asses off for me and put a massive investment into my education and I couldn’t feel more guilty with myself for fucking it up especially when I used to go above and beyond for them before. I wish I could start all over from scaratch. if I had no one counting on me I seriously would consider dropping out with how much I hate this. i’m reaching a limit with how much effort i’ve been giving to and idk how much I can keep going. \n\nI find this school very unsupportive of students like me and again I feel really stuck in terms of the people I know and the social situation i’ve put myself in . Another goal of mine is to live somewhere else. my thought is that if I transfer away I can be someone i’m not, and at least attempt to build a network of people I know in a place where my desired field is much more accessible as an attempt to increase chances of being hired. even if that doesn’t work and I fuck that up too I could start my failed adult life in a place I want to live?",
