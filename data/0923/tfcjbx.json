I’m only taking 4 classes (16 credits) and i feel so unmotivated and overwhelmed.  my earliest class is at 11am and i can’t get myself up out of bed to go every morning. i don’t know what to do or how to get out of the funk i’m in. \n\nOne of my college professors emailed me saying that I need to be more active and participate in class because my grade is low. The course material have the time is completely difficult for me to understand and I always attend office hours to try and get more help but I just can’t seem to graph the concept sometimes. it just makes me feel guilty and then when I do attend class I feel like I’m the only person that’s not understanding what’s being taught.  I had to drop one my labs the semester because I didn’t have the time and I stopped putting in the effort to try and get all of the work done. I was putting in about three hours of prep work for a class that I only had once a week, which I think is absolutely ridiculous. The lecture for that class takes about nine hours of work outside of the lectures. \n\nat this point I just have no idea what to do and how to get out of this hole that I’m in\n\n\nTLDR , I’ve been procrastinating course work and have had little motivation when it comes to school and I don’t know what to do.",
