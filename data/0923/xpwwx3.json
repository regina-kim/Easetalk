  "concern": "title: Choosing between jobs that are better financially and one’s that add to your resume\nThis decision has been bothering me for the past couple of days. I’m a computer science major who is studying for my masters (am a freshman atm) but choosing where to work during the school year isn’t exactly as easy as your summer job, obviously. My school has an IT department that students can work for that seems like pretty great experience and allows a little bump to my resume when I am to apply for internships in the tech field. \n\nOn the other hand though, you have jobs like Doordash that allow more flexibility in your schedule (which would be extremely helpful) and just pay significantly more. I’m not just referring to Doordash but many jobs in the area. This is not a straightforward do this or do that question of course, but I’m just stuck at a cross roads and am having a hard time choosing. Anyone got any pointers on what I should choose here? This isn’t going to be a full commitment, I hope to get an internship instead as I progress through college, but the choice still matters, thanks so much for the help in advance.",
