  "concern": "title: Starting school soon\nSo I've been out of school for about 6 years and I am entering community college in may, I'm self-conscious about how I do on my PERT test, I know it doesn't matter all that much, but I feel the necessity to try to learn everything back from highschool,. I feel like I am compromising myself by telling my self I have to get back up to par by cramming Algebra1, geometry, and Algebra2 all before I start, but also feels like so much I just sit there in awe because it feels insurmountable. I guess my real question would be, should I even have to worry about relearning on my own time? Should I just go with the flow when I start school? or even just try to do the baseline of algebra? I know I also have science, writing, and reading skills to brush up but I assume those are rather quick to pick up again.\n\nEDIT: Im also working full time currently and plan to do so while in school",
