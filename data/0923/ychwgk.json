I'm doing a lot of tutoring, but I'm always two assignments behind. I still have until November 28 to withdraw, but I'm probably going to withdraw and I just feel like a failure. I go to a community college and my girlfriend goes to a university and majoring in the same thing as me, but her workload and due dates are much more crazier than mines. I know I shouldn't be comparing, but it makes me feel such a failure and a disappointment to myself and to her. How do I get around this feeling and thoughts? This is my second year, but I feel like I will be behind from getting my Associate's and my two certificates, while my girlfriend should be getting hers this year.",
