  "concern": "title: Roommate brings her friend to sleep at our dorm every other night\nI know these kinds of posts show up every day on this sub and that if I have a problem with my roommate I should talk to them about it, but I can’t help but wonder if I’m being over dramatic. \n\nMy roommate for the past few months has been bringing her friend to sleep in our dorm. At the beginning, she asked me if it was okay and I said yes. And at first, everything was fine. She’d bring this friend every so often to our place and they would sleep the night with us. \n\nBut more recently, she’s been bringing them almost every other day and it’s starting to get quite unnerving to say the least. Mind you, I am 18F and her friend is 18M so it makes it kinda awkward for him to be sleeping here. \n\nAnd this would all be fine if we lived in a suite of some sort, but our dorm is traditional style and so we don’t have the luxury of our own private rooms. In fact, I can literally see her bed right across from mine while she is sleeping with her friend.\n\nBefore, she used to put a mattress on the floor next to her bed for him to sleep on, but now it’s literally them both sleeping together in the same bed which has made it even more uncomfortable. \n\nIs this a normal thing to do in college? I don’t really know if this is something I should tolerate or how to go about confronting this issue if it’s something I shouldn’t.",
