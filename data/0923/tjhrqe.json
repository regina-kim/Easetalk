  "concern": "title: Im unhappy with my college and its location, but is it worth leaving\nIâ€™m currently a 18M freshman at Parsons The New School of Design in NYC as a Communication Design major (graphic design). This has been my dream school since I was 10 years old but unfortunately after being here for almost 2 semesters, I donâ€™t like it. The classes arenâ€™t as engaging/ geared towards my field of study as I hoped they would be. I find myself being forced to take a lot of useless classes when I could be taking more graphic design oriented courses. \nIâ€™m from Connecticut and used to a suburban lifestyle. I enjoy having the option of driving my car places. I thought the New York lifestyle would be something new and exciting for me because itâ€™s something iâ€™ve always dreamed of, however I just donâ€™t seem to fit in. Itâ€™s not enjoyable for me and im usually scared anywhere I go after dusk. Itâ€™s very hard to make friends here, and having that handicap has made it hard to venture out and enjoy the city. I feel very alone and isolated here. However, New York is an amazing place for opportunities, especially in the art field, and Iâ€™m wondering if iâ€™m throwing away my dream/ chances at a good job by moving back to Connecticut to go to an art school there? I donâ€™t know what jobs would be available for me in CT, and iâ€™m worried iâ€™ll fail and not make money if I move back there. Should I find a way to enjoy New York so I can continue going to school here, or should I move to somewhere Iâ€™m comfortable? Is New York really worth the job opportunities for graphic design artists?",
