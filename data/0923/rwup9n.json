  "concern": "title: Form to switch from thesis to non thesis\nI am scared and in dilemma. This is my second semester here. My advisor has been unhappy with me for sometimes because I couldn't meet the deadline with my thesis timeline. \n\nAlso since in our last visit, I asked some silly question which made her judge my intellectual level perhaps. I zone in and out of conversation a lot and she thinks I do not pay attention to the details.\n\nLast time, I sent her a proposal draft and she never got back to on that. Just like that, semester ended. After filling up a evaluation form, she now says that I should give up thesis. She sent me a bunch of comments saying I couldn't stick to the deadline and I am bad at communication as I never sent her a follow up email on the proposal draft. \n\nI sent her an email asking for her genuine guidance. My dilemma is I am an international student and am sustaining here because of the scholarship and stipend. If I change to thesis, I believe I will lose both. Now that the winter semester is starting, I don't know if should switch as she advised me or convince her to let me do my thesis. If I do convince her, I feel like she would be hard on me. \n\nThe way she is pressuring me to drop the thesis makes me feel like she just doesn't want me to be part of her project anymore.",
