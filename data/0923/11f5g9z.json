My methodology includes looking at blogposts and newspapers of people who interact with these images. Im using first hand accounts. Some of these blog posts discuss a legend associated to a specific object, but there isnâ€™t much discussed further. I canâ€™t find any additional literature on it. \n\nI feel like a fraud and I donâ€™t know how else to deal with it. Nothing is published or written yet, but I feel like im just not doing a good job. No sign from my supervisor either, even though I messaged him. \n\nI feel stupid. I based my idea on an assumption. I have a bunch of academic articles that can back up this assumption though.\n\nI know it sounds super vague but I just feel like shit. How have you gotten over mistakes or discrepancies in your research?",
