  "concern": "title: Would starting therapy when I start grad school be a bad idea?\nFor context, I'm joining my top choice this Fall (in the US). For the last year or so, I've been really feeling that I need to go to therapy. I have an extremely low self esteem, social anxiety and I've just been stressed over the smallest of things which manifests itself as irritation and general unpleasantness. The reason I haven't gone yet is that I live at home and I share my room with a younger sibling. There's no way for me to get privacy without asking for it and I don't want my parents to know about this. My mom kinda understands but my dad doesn't really get it and has been very apprehensive. I know that if I insist, he won't stop me but I don't want to have to deal with the awkwardness considering that they would know everytime I go for a session since I'd have to kick my younger sibling out of the room. I'd rather do it privately and handle this on my own before involving my parents. \n\nI've been at home since the pandemic began and I've been itching to move out which is why I'm very grateful for grad school. I'd like to start therapy as soon as possible since I worry about my ability to function as an adult in a new setting when I'm struggling with every human interaction. My only concern is that I'm sure therapy will be taxing (mentally and emotionally) and grad school will be taxing in so many ways. Would it be a good idea to do start both at the same time or should I wait some more? Are my assumptions that therapy would be too distracting correct?",
