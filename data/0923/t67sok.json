  "concern": "title: How do I stop stressing over a bad grade on a paper?\nI made a stupid mistake. I had to miss 2 weeks of my English class because of a really terrible family issue. I stayed kept up on my work, and wrote what I thought was a very terrific paper. Unbeknownst to me, I didn’t fully read the rubric and I didn’t include some necessary information. I received a 50 on the paper, with my professor saying I had a fantastic prose but I was just missing content. I have the opportunity to COMPLETELY redo the paper at the end of the semester, yet seeing that F in the gradebook just makes my stomach turn. I’m stressed for absolutely no reason but I can’t stop. I keep worrying I’ll mess up the redo, or I’ll mess up my next papers. It makes me so scared because I’m normally a fantastic english student. I no longer feel confident in my work. How can I put myself in perspective here?",
