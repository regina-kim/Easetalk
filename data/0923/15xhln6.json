I was homeschooled all through out high school, which wasnâ€™t the best for me and honestly I didnâ€™t learn much. On top of that, my ADHD and depression have given me severe memory loss, so i donâ€™t remember much that i did learn. Iâ€™m horrible at simple math, i still have to count on my fingers, and i have trouble spelling and sounding words out. Iâ€™m just really scared iâ€™m going to look like a dumbass and it makes me not want to go. I was picked on in middle school for having learning troubles and iâ€™m worried itâ€™s going to be the same. That my professors or the students will think iâ€™m stupid. What if they call on me during lecture and i donâ€™t know the answer then everyone thinks iâ€™m dumb lol. Please help, my anxiety is so bad i want to skip my first day.",
