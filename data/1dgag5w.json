  "concern": "I graduated in December of 2023. It was one of the happiest days of my life. I was in a tough and rigorous program, where I had to meet numerous requirements, those of which were dependent on wether I would graduate or not. The stress of the uncompleted requirements hanging over my head constantly, not being able to sleep the night of my 7am-6pm clinicals, eating my emotions 24/7, along with dealing with some toxic people in a class of 11; let’s just say, I couldn’t be happier to go home. To get out of there. To never look back. That, is exactly what I’ve done. Today, I sit here in bed, and I think about, specifically, the last year and a half, the peak of my educational program. To sum things up, it almost feels like a fever dream. Like it was never real. A part of me likes that. The other half of me is frightened by that. I often think there’s something wrong with me. To believe that all of that really happened. That I was in another city, away from my family, living on my own. Instead of studying to take my boards like others in my class have, I haven’t touched the material since. Every song I hear from that time period, every reminder, takes me back, to a dark place. A place that, when it’s bed time, I dream I must eventually go back to, in order to complete my doctorate; my soul wishes that things are different this time around. In my dreams, I am always trying to escape. Always being abandoned by my family. Yearning to be any place but there. I wonder, if I could’ve avoided engaging with a certain toxic person, that things would have been different. A “friend” who weighed me down just as much as my academic stress did. Someone who’s actions spoke louder than their words. Someone I was only of use to when it came to giving advice about her multiple situationships. I tried to run from her, but she wouldn’t let me. A narcissistic, master manipulator. I wish, that my parents could feel what I felt, in my time there. My siblings see it as the door to freedom, an escape from a beautiful garden, that is my household. I see it as one of the worse times of my life. To remember that Covid-19 was my escape from the most depressing time in my life, shocks me. Packing my stuff and leaving, to never look back, for the next year and a half. Despite my experience, on December 9th, I sat proudly in that chair, not giving a care at all. The most toxic person I’ve ever met in my life, was sitting next to me during my happy time; yet again, talking about someone else. I didn’t even care. I was so happy, to just be done with it all. To say goodbye, to never look back. To not have to hold onto a friendship with any of those people anymore, even though I wanted to, because they weren’t all toxic. The darkness of my past comes creeping back when I text them or engage with them. I am no longer in contact with her, because I stood my ground. I just pray and hope, that things will be different this time around. I wish I could complete my doctorate from home, without having to leave my safe place. I still wonder, why my brain chose to react the way it did, my emotions. Was it ever real?",
