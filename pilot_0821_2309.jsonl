What do you think I could do to kinda build on that or make those focused moments happen more often?\ntherapist: It’s great that you’ve identified a setting that helps you focus, even if it’s not always accessible. Perhaps we could brainstorm ways to create a similar environment at home or explore routines that help you transition into a focused mindset, like a pre-study ritual. What do you think might help you make those focused moments happen more often?\nclient: Hey, I think having some kinda routine or ritual before studying could maybe help get my brain in gear, like listening to a specific playlist or setting up my space in a certain way. I’m just not sure what would work best, and I worry I might still get sidetracked even with that—any ideas on how to figure out what could stick or keep me locked in?\ntherapist: It sounds like you've already identified some promising ideas, such as creating a pre-study ritual or setting up your space in a specific way. Let's explore these ideas further and see if we can find a way to make them work for you. How do you think you could start implementing these strategies, and what do you think might help you stay consistent with them?\nclient: Hey, I’m thinking I could start by picking a short playlist that I only use for studying, and maybe clear off my desk each time to make it feel like a fresh start. I’m just worried I’ll forget to do it or lose the habit after a few days—do you have any tips on how to keep myself on track with sticking to something like this?\ntherapist: That's a great start, and I like how you're thinking about ways to create a consistent routine. One idea could be to pair your pre-study ritual with a specific time of day or activity, like making a cup of tea or turning on your desk lamp before studying. This can help signal to your brain that it's time to focus. How do you think you could incorporate something like that into your daily routine?\nclient: Hey, I think pairing the ritual with something I already do, like making tea or flipping on my desk lamp, could definitely help make it more automatic. I’m just not sure how to pick a good time or habit to tie it to—any suggestions on how to figure out what might work best for my day?\ntherapist: It seems like you're on the right track with creating a pre-study ritual and setting up a specific space. To find a time or habit to tie your ritual to, you could start by paying attention to your daily routine and noticing when you feel most focused or energized. This could be a good indicator of when your brain is ready to engage in studying. Maybe you could experiment with a few different times or habits to see what works best for you?\nclient: Hey, that makes sense, I can totally try to notice when I’m feeling more alert or ready to dive into stuff during the day. I’m just a bit worried I might not pick the right time or keep up with experimenting—do you have any advice on how to track this or stay motivated to test out different times?\ntherapist: One idea could be to keep a simple journal or use a notes app on your phone to track your energy levels and focus throughout the day. You could also try setting a reminder on your phone to check in with yourself at certain times, asking, \"\"How focused do I feel right now?\"\" or \"\"Is this a good time for studying?\"\" This way, you can collect some data and see if there's a pattern. Additionally, you could try reframing your experimenting as \"\"playing around with different times\"\" rather than \"\"testing\"\" them, which might help reduce any pressure or stress you might feel.\nclient: Hey, I like the idea of using a journal or notes app to track my energy and focus—it feels doable to just jot down a quick note. I’m just a little nervous about forgetting to check in with myself or not sticking with it—do you have any tips on making those reminders or tracking feel less like a chore?\nclient: Hey, I get that keeping up with reminders and tracking can feel like extra work. Maybe you could tie the check-ins to something you’re already doing, like grabbing a snack or checking your phone, so it just blends into your day—does that sound like it could work?\nclient: Hey, yeah, tying the check-ins to something I already do, like grabbing a snack, could definitely make it feel more natural. I’m just a bit concerned about still spacing out on it—do you have any other ideas to help it stick without feeling like a burden?\nclient: Hey, I’m glad that idea feels like it could fit into your routine. Maybe you could also set a quick alarm or notification on your phone for those moments, just as a little nudge—do you think that’d help keep it on your radar without being annoying?\nclient: Hey, yeah, setting a quick alarm or notification sounds like it could be a helpful nudge. I’m just a bit worried about it feeling intrusive—do you have any thoughts on how to make it subtle or easy to ignore if I’m in the middle of something?","completed":true}

Feel free to share whatever's on your mind—I'm all ears and ready to listen without judgment. What would you like to talk about today?\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here to listen. I’m just really struggling with getting started on my prelim proposal for my grad program, and I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed without much guidance right now.\ntherapist: That sounds really tough—I can imagine feeling overwhelmed when faced with such an important task without clear guidance. It's totally understandable to feel stuck when you're unsure where to start. Can you tell me a bit more about what’s been making this so challenging for you?\nclient: client: Yeah, it’s just this mix of not knowing how to even approach the writing and feeling like I’m on my own with my advisor gone. I keep sitting down to start, but my brain just freezes up, and I end up spiraling into doubt about whether I’m even cut out for this.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're facing a double challenge: navigating the uncertainty of the proposal process while also feeling unsupported without your advisor. That must be really frustrating. Can you share a bit more about what happens when you sit down to start writing and your brain freezes up?\nclient: Yeah, it’s like I open my laptop, stare at the blank page, and my mind just goes completely blank or jumps to all the worst-case scenarios. I start thinking I don’t even know enough to write this, and then I just shut down and walk away feeling worse than before.\ntherapist: That must be so disheartening, especially when you're already feeling isolated and uncertain about the process. It's like your mind is caught in a loop of self-doubt and anxiety, making it impossible to break through the inertia. Can you help me understand what specifically triggers these worst-case scenarios when you sit down to write?\nclient: Honestly, it’s mostly this fear that I’m gonna mess up something crucial, like missing a key part of the proposal or not being prepared enough for the defense. I keep imagining my committee just tearing it apart, and I feel like I don’t even know what they expect since I can’t ask my advisor right now.\n\nMan, it’s just exhausting even thinking about it. I guess I’m also worried that since the data for my study isn’t fully collected yet, I won’t have enough to show, and I don’t know how to frame that in the proposal without it looking like a weakness. Have you worked with other students who’ve been in a similar spot? Like, how did they deal with this kind of block?\ntherapist: Many students face similar challenges when their advisor isn't available and they're juggling the pressure of proposal writing. One common strategy they've found helpful is to focus on creating a rough outline first, breaking down the proposal into smaller, manageable sections. Others have found it helpful to visualize the proposal as a story that needs to be told, rather than a test to be passed. Have you ever tried starting with a rough outline or imagining your proposal as a narrative?\nclient: Nah, I haven’t really tried breaking it down into an outline or thinking of it as a story yet. I guess I’ve been so stuck on the idea of it needing to be perfect from the get-go that I didn’t even consider starting small like that. Do you think just jotting down whatever comes to mind for each section could help, even if it’s messy? I’m worried I’ll still get stuck overthinking each part.\ntherapist: It's natural to feel hesitant about starting small when you're used to aiming for perfection, but often the act of just getting something down, even if it's messy, can help loosen the grip of overthinking. What if you tried writing a single section, just letting your thoughts flow freely without editing, and see how it feels to have something tangible on the page?\nclient: Yeah, I think I could give that a shot, just writing out a section without worrying about it being polished. Honestly, even the idea of having something on the page, no matter how rough, feels like it might take some of this weight off. How do you think I should pick which section to start with? Like, should I go for something I feel more confident about, or tackle the part that’s stressing me out the most to get it over with?\ntherapist: You could start with the section that feels most familiar or manageable to build momentum, or you might choose the one causing the most stress to confront it head-on. It’s your call, and whichever feels right to you is a good choice. What do you think you’d prefer to tackle first?\nclient: I think I’d probably start with something I feel more confident about, like the background or lit review part, just to get the ball rolling without freaking myself out too much. I’m kinda scared that if I jump straight into the stressful stuff, like the data gaps, I’ll just freeze up again. Does that sound like a decent plan, or do you think I’m just avoiding the hard part by doing that?\ntherapist: Starting with the background or literature review section sounds like a solid plan, especially if it feels more manageable and can help you build momentum. It's not about avoiding the harder parts, but rather about taking a step that feels doable right now, which is a great way to make progress without getting overwhelmed.\nclient: Cool, I’m glad you think that’s a good way to go.

I am a CS grad student, so all of my works are done behind a few monitors.  Every time I take a break, whether it be for lunch or for once-in-hours break, once I start taking a break, I get so absorbed into it that I cannot get out of it. Most commonly, I watch YouTube videos (streams &amp; stuff) during breaks because I don't know what else to do during the break and I find this activity the most amusing.  I have tried using a timer, but I tend to give myself extra few minutes over and over, and eventually not stopping, ugh! I also heard having a regular schedule might help, but I'm not sure how to set a regular schedule given that my work only involves research (no workout, nada) and it's difficult to get out of break in the first place.\n\nI don't know if this is common, but I am the guy who gets immersed into work very quickly and likes to continue working straight, until my day's work gets to the end. Yes, I prefer work without breaks.  However, people say it's important to take breaks, and there is also some unskippable breaks like lunch and dinner.  What is the way to have a healthy break that does not break my work momentum?\n\nNow, some may recommend working out, but I unfortunately am a \"strong\" at-home person and doesn't really like working out.  I think break should be giving me some dopamine, but workout should give me near-zero dopamine, while YouTubing gives me enticingly high amount of dopamine.

I like the idea of reframing how I think about my degree—focusing on what I bring to the table instead of what I think I’m missing. Practicing how to talk about it could help too, ‘cause I always stumble over my words when someone asks. Do you have any tips on how to explain it in a way that sounds strong and not like I’m making excuses? And maybe some ways to kinda quiet that voice in my head that keeps doubting me?\ntherapist: You're already showing great self-awareness by recognizing the need to shift your focus towards your strengths and practical skills. One approach could be to prepare a concise, confident response that highlights the unique aspects of your PSM degree, such as its emphasis on real-world application or the specific skills you've gained. As for quieting that doubting voice, try to acknowledge it without letting it take over—remind yourself of your hard work and accomplishments, and focus on how your diverse background brings a valuable perspective to your work.\nclient: **Client (responding as the client):** Thanks, that’s really helpful. I think having a go-to line about my PSM being focused on practical, hands-on skills could make me sound more sure of myself. And yeah, I need to keep reminding myself of what I’ve done instead of what I think I lack—it’s just tough sometimes when that doubt creeps in. How do you suggest I start building that habit of focusing on the positive stuff, especially on days when I’m feeling like a total fraud?\ntherapist: To help you build that habit of focusing on the positive, let's start by creating a personalized affirmation that highlights your strengths and accomplishments. This could be something like, \"\"I earned my PSM through hard work and determination, and my unique blend of skills and experiences brings value to my work.\"\" Repeating this affirmation to yourself, especially on days when you're feeling doubtful, can help to counteract those negative thoughts. Another approach could be to keep a \"\"success journal\"\" where you write down one thing you accomplished each day, no matter how small. Over time, this can help you build a mindset that focuses on your strengths and achievements, rather than your perceived shortcomings.\nclient: **Client (responding as the client):** Hey, I really like the idea of the affirmation thing—it feels kinda cheesy at first, but I can see how repeating something positive could stick with me over time. And the success journal sounds cool too, like a way to actually see proof of what I’m doing right instead of just dwelling on the negatives. I think I’ll start with jotting down even little wins, like solving a problem at work or getting through a tough meeting. Do you think it’s okay if some days I can’t think of anything big to write down, or should I push myself to find something no matter what? Also, how long do you think it takes before this kinda stuff starts to really change how I feel about myself?\ntherapist: That's great to hear that you're open to trying these strategies! It's perfectly fine if some days you can't think of anything big to write down in your success journal—the important thing is to be consistent and recognize that even small accomplishments are worth acknowledging. Over time, you may find that you're able to identify more of these moments, and they can become a valuable source of encouragement. As for how long it takes to see a change in how you feel about yourself, everyone is different, but many people start to notice a shift within a few weeks of practicing affirmations and keeping a success journal. The key is to be patient and persistent, as developing a more positive mindset is a process that takes time and practice.\nclient: **Client (responding as the client):** Cool, I’m glad it’s okay to just write down the small stuff on those off days—takes some pressure off. I’ll stick with it and see how it feels after a few weeks, even if it’s a bit weird at first. Patience isn’t really my strong suit, though, so do you have any tricks to keep me motivated to keep up with the journal and affirmations when I’m tempted to just skip them? And like, what should I do if I start feeling like it’s not working after a while?\nclient: Hey, I’m really glad to hear you’re willing to give it a shot, even if it feels a bit off at first. To keep yourself motivated with the journal and affirmations, maybe try setting a quick daily reminder on your phone or pairing it with something you already do, like having your morning coffee—make it part of a routine. Also, if you start feeling like it’s not working after a while, could we check in about it, or do you have any other ideas for tweaking things to keep it fresh? I just wanna make sure I don’t give up too soon, ya know?","completed":true}
{"id":"11qmcba","timestamp":1678665600000,"category":"emotional","concern":"Cognitive Psychology Ph.D.   \nI'm a 4th year, so you think I'd be used to this! I just have no concept of how much professors have in their discretionary. I'm about to run a study that I've gotten blessing after blessing to run. It's been piloted and I even got a mini $1400 grant for it. Unfortunately, I burned through my money pretty quickly during the pilot\/trying different ideas out and I now have to drop another $800+ on my advisor's dime. I'm up against a time pressure and I know I need to just do it, but I can't not think in terms of regular person money and I get so so nervous!! I've resorted to loading smaller amounts of money into Prolific, which generates an annoying number of receipts to be processed.   \nSome of the anxiety is because I transferred into this lab in the last year, so I feel like all of my expenses are unplanned expenses. Something that makes me feel better is that my advisor was accepting students this round and ultimately didn't, so that tells me that she was prepared to support another student even after taking me on. She's the head of the department and quite well known, so if there were ever a lab to try out different ideas in, it would be this one. But I'm not on a grant and I don't know where her discretionary money comes from.   \nAfter the failed pilots (which was expensive), she even told me that I need something to work so I can design some follow up studies (clock is ticking), so we might as well \"throw money\" at the problem. Another explicit blessing.\n\n  \nI'm sure I'm not the only one who stresses over this. My friend comes from a very prominent lab and even he books youth hostel lodging and bad flights for conferences out of guilt.

I’m worried he’s gonna be upset with me either way—whether I ask him now or just apply without telling him.\ntherapist: I can understand why this situation feels so stressful, especially with everything else going on for you. It sounds like you're caught between two difficult choices, and both options seem to carry a lot of worry.\nclient: Yeah, exactly, I feel stuck no matter what I do. I just don’t know if it’s worse to risk annoying him now with a super late request or to go behind his back and apply without saying anything.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're feeling really torn between these two options, and that's understandable given the situation.

What might be some of the positive outcomes of being upfront with your PI, even if it’s uncomfortable, and how could that align with your values and goals?\nclient: Hey, I think being upfront with my PI could maybe help build trust, even if he’s annoyed at first, ya know?

I have a bit of data collection left to do, but it will be done by the end of this month, then I'll just be submitting papers, editing, preparing the dissertation and presentation, etc.. \n\nBad news: I'm really nervous about the questions. My oral quals went... okay, but it definitely could have gone better. There is one prof in particular, who is super knowledgeable and helpful, and I really respect their opinion. However, I've noticed that if you answer a question incorrectly, or don't know something they think you should know, they have a tendency to then really go in and ask way more intense questions. I know some people say it's okay to say you don't know... that has.. not been my experience with this professor. At one point I said I didn't know, and needed to look into something more, they got pretty frustrated with me and told me it was something I SHOULD know, and if I'm presenting it and don't know, that reflects badly on me. They were totally right, I really should have known the thing, honestly. BUT now I'm terrified I'll get asked something I don't know, knowing how it will go from there.\n\nAnyone have advice on how to anticipate\/be prepared for as many questions as possible?

Before I get into the details, I'll provide a bit of background.\n\nI'm currently a second and final year MSc Biology (2 yrs) international student in the Netherlands, and the way my program is designed, each year I am supposed to find an internship in order to progress and eventually graduate. The university recommends us to do the first internship in-house, meaning under the Faculty of Science and your respective department, only then for the second\/last internship you get to choose to do the internship in a company or another university (company or university can be locally or internationally, students have the option). \n\nI successfully completed my first internship already back in September 2022 and ever since then have been stuck in a hole trying to find an internship here in western Europe. I have tried companies locally and several neighboring countries as well as universities (across the Netherlands) but my efforts have proven to be fruitless thus far. Companies either do not reply or that they are not hiring during this period. In the meantime, I have just been calling and sending emails on a daily basis, even spoke to my program\/study advisor who gave me useful advice and suggestions but still nothing to show. Hell, I have even tried approaching\/connecting with potential employers via Linkedin after receiving such advice but apparently for some I require the premium package, which I do not have, in order to send them a message\n\nI feel like a failure because it's now January 2023 and due to my internship being a mandatory 6-month period in order to get the credits, this all means that I will definitely be graduating late. That, in turn, means more burden on my parents to financially support me.

I’m just really stressed about not finding an internship and feeling like I’m letting my parents down financially.\ntherapist: That sounds incredibly tough—I can only imagine how overwhelming it must feel to balance your own aspirations with the weight of expectations, especially when it comes to your family's financial situation. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind lately, or maybe how this stress has been showing up for you day-to-day?\nclient: Yeah, it’s been weighing on me a lot. I just feel stuck, like no matter how hard I try, I’m not getting anywhere, and it’s messing with my head every single day.\ntherapist: It’s really understandable that you’d feel that way, especially when it seems like no matter how hard you push, you’re not seeing the results you want. What does that sense of being stuck feel like for you, exactly?\nclient: It feels like I’m just spinning my wheels, you know? Like I’m putting in all this effort, but I’m still in the same spot, and it’s exhausting and frustrating all at once.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're caught in this cycle of effort and disappointment, and it's really wearing you down. I'm curious, have you noticed any specific moments or situations where this feeling of being stuck hits you the hardest?\nclient: Yeah, it’s usually when I’m sending out another batch of emails or applications and just getting nothing back, or when I’m checking my inbox and it’s empty again. It’s like every rejection—or even just the silence—feels like a punch, reminding me I’m not moving forward.\ntherapist: I can see how the silence after sending out applications would feel like a heavy reminder of not moving forward. It's a lot to carry, especially when you're already giving your best effort. What would it look like for you to find even a small sense of progress or hope in those moments?\nclient: Honestly, I’m not even sure what that would look like right now. I guess maybe just getting a response, even if it’s a no, would feel like something—like at least I’m being seen, you know?\n\nI just keep thinking, what if this keeps going on for months? I’m already behind, and the longer this drags out, the more I’m letting my parents down by needing their help. It’s like I’m trapped in this loop of trying and failing, and I don’t know how to break out of it. Have you seen other students in situations like this, and did they eventually figure it out, or am I just... I don’t know, doomed to keep struggling?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of effort and disappointment, and it's really wearing you down. I'm curious, have you noticed any specific moments or situations where this feeling of being stuck hits you the hardest?\nclient: Yeah, I’ve seen other students go through similar struggles with internships and job searches, and while it’s tough, many do eventually find a way forward with persistence and support. I’m confident we can work together to explore new strategies or perspectives that might help break this cycle—you’re not doomed to keep struggling.\n\nI just feel so drained, you know? Like, I want to keep pushing, but every day feels heavier, and I’m starting to wonder if I’m even cut out for this. Do you think there’s a point where I should just step back and rethink everything, or is that giving up?\ntherapist: It’s clear how much this struggle has taken out of you, and it’s understandable to question whether pushing through is the right move. Let’s sit with that feeling for a moment—what do you think stepping back might give you that pushing forward right now isn’t? And on the flip side, what would be the hardest part about letting go of the path you’re on, even temporarily?\nclient: Honestly, stepping back might give me a chance to just breathe, you know, like take the pressure off for a bit and maybe figure out if there’s another way to approach this whole internship mess. But the hardest part about letting go, even just for a little while, would be feeling like I’m admitting defeat, and I’m terrified of disappointing my parents even more than I already have. What if I step back and then can’t get back on track? I just don’t know if I’d be able to handle that.\ntherapist: I hear the fear of defeat and the pressure to please your parents, and it's clear that stepping back feels like a heavy, risky move. What if we reframed this pause not as giving up, but as a strategic reset—a chance to recharge and come back stronger? Have you thought about what support systems might help you navigate this reset, even if it's just for a little while?\nclient: Yeah, I hadn’t really thought of it as a strategic reset before—that kinda makes it feel less like failing. I guess I could lean on friends or maybe even talk more with my study advisor about taking a short break, but I’m still worried about how to explain this to my parents without them thinking I’m just giving up. Do you think there’s a way to frame this to them so it doesn’t sound like I’m slacking off? I just don’t want them to worry even more.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're beginning to see that taking a break doesn't have to be a negative thing, but a way to regroup and recharge. It might help to approach the conversation with your parents from a place of honesty and vulnerability, emphasizing your desire to make the best decision for your future and your willingness to work with them to find a solution.\nclient: Yeah, I like the idea of being honest with them, but I’m still kinda nervous about how they’ll react since they’re already stressed about supporting me. I just wanna make sure they see I’m not throwing in the towel, you know? How do I even start that convo without it turning into a lecture about how I need to try harder? I feel like I’m already doing everything I can, and I don’t know how to make them get that.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you're worried about how your parents might react, but approaching them with honesty and a clear plan for your reset could help them see your perspective. What if you started the conversation by acknowledging their concerns and then explaining how this break could ultimately help you succeed in the long run?\nclient: Yeah, that makes sense—acknowledging their worries first might help ease them into the idea that I’m not just giving up. I think I could try saying something like, I know you’ve been supporting me a lot, and I’m working on a plan to make sure I don’t let you down, but I need a short break to figure out the best way forward. Do you think that sounds okay, or should I add more about what I’ll do during the break so they don’t think I’m just sitting around? I’m just so scared they’ll think I’m wasting time, you know?\ntherapist: That sounds like a great way to start the conversation, but you might consider adding a few specific details about how you plan to use the break to recharge and refocus—like mentioning your intention to set goals, seek support, or practice self-care—to help your parents understand that this isn't a passive step back. How do you feel about incorporating those ideas into your explanation?\nclient: I think adding those details could really help, like telling them I’ll be working on my applications with a clearer head or maybe even taking a short course to boost my skills. I’m just wondering if that’ll be enough to convince them I’m still on track, or if I should prepare for some pushback anyway, you know?\ntherapist: You've got some great ideas to include in your conversation with your parents. Remember, you can't control their reactions, but you can control how you present your plan. Preparing for potential pushback might help you feel more confident, and it's okay to acknowledge their concerns while still standing firm in your decision. How do you think you might handle their questions or worries if they do arise?\nclient: I guess I’d try to stay calm and just keep explaining that this break isn’t me giving up, but more like a way to make sure I’m moving forward in the right direction. I’d probably say something like, I get why you’re worried, but I really believe this will help me come back stronger—can we talk about how I can keep you updated on my progress? How do you think I should respond if they still push back hard, like if they start saying I’m just making excuses? I’m kinda worried I’ll freeze up or get defensive if it gets too heated.\ntherapist: You've already shown great insight in recognizing that staying calm and reiterating your commitment to progress is key. If things escalate, try grounding yourself by taking a breath, and then refocus the conversation by asking them to share their concerns and listen attentively—this can help de-escalate tensions. Remember, you're not alone in this; we can role-play potential scenarios if you'd like to practice.\nclient: I really appreciate the idea of taking a breath and listening to their concerns—that sounds like it could help keep things from getting too heated. I’d definitely be up for role-playing some scenarios with you because I’m still nervous about freezing up or saying the wrong thing if they push hard. What kind of situations do you think we should practice? Like, should we focus on them accusing me of making excuses or maybe them just not understanding why I need a break at all? I just wanna feel prepared for whatever might come up, you know?\nclient: I’m glad you’re open to practicing together—it’s a great way to build confidence. Maybe we could start with them not understanding the need for a break, since that feels like a common sticking point, and then move to handling accusations if there’s time? What do you think would be most helpful to tackle first? I just want to make sure I’m ready for the toughest parts of the convo.\nclient: I’m cool with starting wherever you think makes the most sense. Honestly, I just want to focus on whatever will help me feel most prepared for the trickier moments, so if you think one scenario is more likely or tougher, let’s dive into that first.\nclient: therapist: I’m glad you’re eager to dive in and build that confidence. Let’s start with them not understanding the need for a break since it seems like a foundational issue that could set the tone for the rest of the conversation, and then we can tackle the accusations if time allows. Does that sound good to you?\n\nclient: Yeah, that sounds perfect. I think starting with their lack of understanding will help me get a handle on the core of the convo before moving to the tougher stuff.","completed":true}
{"id":"11v1z0j","timestamp":1679097600000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"My 2 year program has a cohort of 30 people and I feel like I’m always finding out about gatherings after the fact. Last semester, I consistently saw Snapchat\/IG stories and updates on bar hang outs, games, and more literally every week. Sometimes even more. But they were usually during or after the event. I tried to participate but how am I supposed to attend if I had no idea it was happening? And it’d get awkward when I was asking “what’s going on?” or “what are you guys talking about?”. Someone once even said “Poor (my name), she keeps thinking there’s a group chat for this when we plan it spontaneously”. I just get left out because no one tells me. I get that I’m more introverted, but I really do try to talk and participate in conversations and have been mistaken as an extrovert by an extrovert before. I’ve really worked on this over the years. And other introverts in the class somehow also find out about the events, parties, and gatherings. \n\nPart of me felt ok - I tried to make myself feel better by saying that those people just don’t have a life outside of the program. And that I wanted to have more of a balance. Seeing the same people 5 days a week a day PLUS some evenings and most weekends is a lot! On top of 5-6 classes and student clubs and volunteering, I have a GA position, casual job, serious relationship, family, and other friends to balance. I feel ridiculous and in the minority for feeling this way. \n\nNow that it’s March, there seems to be less of these events happening second semester, but it still hurts when someone sends a video or picture (e.g. group selfie) to the cohort group text and it’s like almost everybody is in it. This literally happened last night at 2AM for someone’s st patty party. I can’t silent the notifications or not check because sometimes there are important announcements to know. I try to shrug it off and not let it get to me but I feel ashamed that I’ve cried over this before.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome to our counseling session today!

I’m pretty late because I got diagnosed with OCD and it absolutely turned my life around. It took a lot of work to finally get to the point of taking and passing the NCLEX, but we’re here. \n\nHowever, a huge, huge dream of mine, is to eventually practice as an Psych NP. \n\nI wanted to practice as a nurse for a year (as recommended) go to school full time, and be done within 2 years instead of 4. This trajectory would let me graduate at 29-31 years old. \n\nGetting my own place would make grad school difficult, no doubt. I’d have to cut hours in my job, pay my bills somehow, go to clinicals after work\/do homework as well. It would just make life a lot harder\n\nIf I stayed, I wouldn’t have to pay rent. I could pay some chunks off my loans, go to school full time and work part time so I’d save cash. The stress of trying to survive and keep it all together wouldn’t be there, which leaves me more time to focus on school.\n\nHowever, that’s a long time with my parents. Everywhere I see, everyone advocates moving out and getting your life together on your own. I really can’t help but feel like a loser. \n\nBut at the same time, If I just stay an RN, I’m not making the money or living the life I want. I prob wouldn’t stay in the city I’m in and love and would move to somewhere more affordable. And this would be all for society accepting me for independence \n\nMy dating life and social life would prob suffer due to judgment from being home as well.

What do you think would be the most important step in aligning your current path with your ideal one, without letting judgment hold you back?\nclient: Honestly, I think the most important step would be just owning my decision and not letting other people’s opinions get to me. Like, I need to build up some confidence in my plan and remind myself why staying home makes sense for my goals right now, you know?\ntherapist: It's great that you're starting to see how staying with your parents could be a strategic move that aligns with your long-term goals. What do you think would help you build that confidence and own your decision, especially when facing those judgmental thoughts or comments from others?\nclient: I think having a solid plan and sticking to it would really help me feel more confident, like mapping out my school and work schedule to show myself I’m making progress. Also, maybe talking to people who get it, like friends or mentors who’ve been through similar stuff, could help me feel less alone in this and brush off the judgmental vibes, you know?\ntherapist: That’s a really thoughtful approach, and it’s great that you’re considering both practical planning and emotional support. Maybe you could also consider reframing any potential criticism as feedback that’s not necessarily about you, but rather about others’ expectations or misunderstandings. How do you think that might help shift your perspective?\nclient: I think reframing criticism like that could really take some of the sting out of it, like realizing it’s more about their lens than my choices. It might help me stay focused on my path without feeling so weighed down by what others think, you know?\ntherapist: That sounds like a really empowering way to reframe things. What do you think would be the most helpful step to take first—creating a schedule, talking to supportive friends, or practicing that mindset shift?\nclient: Honestly, I think starting with creating a schedule would be the most helpful first step. It’d give me something concrete to hold onto, like a roadmap, and help me feel like I’m actively moving forward, you know?\nclient: therapist: That makes a lot of sense—having a tangible plan can really anchor you. Let’s start by sketching out a basic schedule next session if you’re up for it, and we can brainstorm ways to make it flexible yet motivating.\n\nclient: Yeah, I’d really like that. It’d be cool to get a rough draft going and figure out how to keep it realistic with everything else on my plate.\nclient: therapist: Great, I’m glad you’re on board with that. We’ll dive into it next time and make sure it fits your life and goals.\n\nclient: Awesome, I’m looking forward to it. Thanks for helping me sort through this stuff—it’s nice to have a space to figure it all out.","completed":true}
{"id":"123ppzd","timestamp":1679875200000,"category":"school_life","concern":"In undergrad, I was on top of my shit. Gears changing constantly. Though the classes were easier, there were more of them and the subjects were more varied. Work\/internship\/research. Student organizations. Events and planning. Prep for professional life and grad school. Social life. So many things, and I rarely if ever dropped the ball. I felt like a machine. Fulfilling and purposeful work. We were all ready to change the world.\n\nIn grad school, dropping the ball has become business as usual. Throughout my department, people drop commitments without announcement, show up late to meetings, miss deadlines, and send emails after the fact - sometimes apologetic and others accusatory. Presentations and papers are thrown together last minute, and lectures are permeated with the constant undertone, \"There are much better uses of my time than this,\" from both instructors and students. Resources to prepare for industry or education (anything outside of research, really) are scant - treated as obligatory by the department - and those who seek them out are viewed as admitting burnout or a lack of commitment or skill. Research is carried out with petty comments and measuring contests. People trade shady favors, becoming authors of papers to which they didn't contribute and exchanging techniques to fudge numbers and buy time. Those who are seated in tenured research positions seem constantly frazzled. If you ever ask them how to develop yourself, where to find meaning, how to generate questions and goals, you get a weak laugh and some half-hearted talk for 5min. Watching them work has been like watching someone stuck in a bad marriage. The encouragements that have come my way feel like the lies people tell themselves while losing religion.\n\nI've never caved to academic dishonesty, but I can't deny that the lack of professionalism has rubbed off on me. It's hard for anyone to generate sincerity and drive in a system this demoralizing. What happened?? How do I dig out?","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome to our session today! I'm here to listen and support you without judgment.

Like, I don’t want to come across as needy or out of place—any ideas on how to break the ice in a way that feels natural?\ntherapist: Sure, I get that concern. How about asking someone about their experience with a project or topic related to the meetup? Something like, \"\"What drew you to this field?\"\" or \"\"I’m curious, what’s one thing you’ve learned recently that’s stuck with you?\"\" These kinds of questions can spark meaningful conversations without coming across as desperate or out of place.\nclient: Thanks, those are solid ideas for starting a convo without feeling like I’m oversharing or coming off weird. I can see myself asking something like that and just seeing where it goes.\n\nI’m still kinda stuck on the thought of whether these interactions will actually help me feel less alone in all this grad school mess. Like, what if I meet people, but it’s just surface-level stuff and I’m still left feeling disconnected—do you have any thoughts on how to build something deeper from those initial chats?\ntherapist: Sure, that's a valid concern. One idea could be to look for common ground or shared experiences during those initial conversations, and then follow up with a more personal question or comment that invites further discussion. For example, if someone mentions a challenge they've faced, you could say something like, \"\"That sounds tough—how did you manage to navigate that situation?\"\" or \"\"I’ve experienced something similar, it’s helpful to know I’m not the only one.\"\"\nRemember, building deeper connections often takes time, so it's okay if it doesn't happen right away. You could also try staying in touch with people you connect with, even if it's just a quick message or coffee meetup, to see if a deeper relationship can develop naturally.\nclient: Got it, I like the idea of finding some common ground and following up with something a bit more personal to dig deeper. It’s reassuring to hear that it’s okay if it takes time—I guess I’ve been putting a lot of pressure on myself to fix this disconnection fast.\n\nI’m just wondering, though, how do I keep myself from getting discouraged if those follow-ups don’t pan out, you know? Like, if I reach out for a coffee or send a message and it just fizzles out or they don’t seem interested, how do I not let that knock me back even further?\ntherapist: That’s a really important question, and it’s understandable to worry about feeling discouraged if things don’t go as planned. One way to approach this might be to focus on the act of reaching out itself as a success, regardless of the outcome. For example, you could think of it as practicing courage and openness, which are valuable in their own right, even if the connection doesn’t deepen right away. It’s also helpful to remember that people’s responses often have more to do with their own circumstances than with you personally, so it’s not necessarily a reflection of your worth or likability.\nclient: Thanks for saying that—it helps to think of just reaching out as a win, even if it doesn’t lead to anything. I guess I’ve been so focused on the end result that I forget the value in just trying.\n\nI’m still kinda worried, though, about how to keep pushing myself to do this when I’m already feeling so drained by the grad school environment. Like, where do I find the energy to keep putting myself out there when everything else feels so heavy?\nclient: I appreciate you bringing that up—it’s real to feel drained with everything grad school throws at you. I’m just wondering if there’s a way to balance taking small steps to connect with also giving myself some space to recharge, you know?\nclient: Thanks for the insight—I like the idea of balancing small steps with some downtime to recharge. Do you have any tips on how I can set boundaries or pace myself so I don’t burn out while still trying to build these connections?\nclient: I’m glad you’re thinking about pacing yourself—it’s definitely important with everything on my plate. I’d love to hear any specific ideas you have on setting those boundaries without feeling like I’m shutting people out completely.\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate you diving into this with me. I’m curious if you have any practical ways I can set those boundaries while still keeping the door open for connections, especially when I’m already stretched thin.\nclient: Thanks for the suggestions—I think having some concrete ways to set boundaries will really help me manage everything. I’m just wondering how I can start small with this, especially when I’m already feeling overwhelmed by deadlines and stuff.\nclient: Thanks for the ideas—I’m definitely going to try starting small with those boundary-setting strategies. Do you think focusing on just one or two things at a time could help me ease into it without adding more stress?\nclient: Thanks for that perspective—I think focusing on just one or two things at a time could really work for me. I’m just a bit worried about keeping up with it all, so do you have any thoughts on how I can stay consistent without feeling like it’s another big task?","completed":false}

{"id":"119bwqj","timestamp":1677024000000,"category":"school_life","concern":"I graduated college less than a year ago (May 2022); and my undergraduate experience was already screwed up by COVID-19 - I was forced to skip out on a full year before returning to Senior year because the US did not allow international students to take hybrid classes and my university was not offering at least 3 in-person classes for me during the 2020 - 2021 lockdown. So I got to watch all my friends graduate without me; I did qualify for an accelerated Master's Program in Economics and I was accepted but I opted not to pursue it due to COVID-19 and feeling that I did not want to stay in Fordham for both undergraduate and graduate school.  \n\n\nAnyway, I somehow managed to get a short-term contract at the World Bank since they hired people from around the world, and if I work for the World Bank in a full-time job for about 15 years I am eligible for permanent residency (green card). For all intents and purposes I really want to stay and live and build a life in the US (especially now with geopolitical events in SE Asia). The problem is that I don't have options for employment in the private sector because the H1-b process is absurdly random and difficult; and the World Bank and IMF have outright told me that I can't get a fulltime job without AT LEAST a Master's Degree (it's already brutally difficult for me to get even a short-term contract role, let alone a fulltime job); and even this employment is not guaranteed.  \n\n\nI'm thinking of getting a Master's Degree in Statistics or Data Science (an MBA or Master's degree in economics isn't very helpful) but I have checked that I did not take enough undergrad courses in Math or Computer Science to qualify (at least in the US). I'm fairly certain that my math skills and coding skills are nowhere near good enough for grad school (I struggled for a 3.60 gpa even before COVID-19)  \nI'm honestly totally lost because I'm being forced to prepare for grad school so soon, just after I managed to find something solid career-wise (I'm 23 turning 24).

I’m just feeling really overwhelmed with my career and grad school decisions, and I’m scared about what might happen if I can’t figure this out soon.\ntherapist: I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed. It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure, and it's understandable to feel scared when faced with big decisions like these.\nclient: Thanks for understanding. I just feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place, ya know, with so much riding on these next steps.\ntherapist: That sounds really challenging. I can see how these big decisions could feel like a heavy weight on your shoulders, and it’s okay to feel stuck. Can you tell me a bit more about what’s making these choices feel so difficult for you?\nclient: Hey, yeah, it’s just that I feel like I don’t have many options, and the ones I do have seem out of reach or risky. I’m worried that if I mess this up, I might lose my shot at staying in the US, and that’s terrifying.\ntherapist: I can see how the pressure to make the right decision is weighing heavily on you, especially with the added stress of staying in the US. It sounds like you're feeling stuck between options that don't seem viable and choices that carry a lot of risk. How does the thought of staying in the US and the consequences of leaving fit into your feelings about your career and grad school decisions?\nclient: Hey, staying in the US is like my ultimate goal, you know, because I feel like I can build a real future here, and going back home just feels like giving up everything I’ve worked for. The grad school and career stuff, it’s all tied to that fear of losing this chance, and I’m just not sure I can handle starting over somewhere else.\ntherapist: It sounds like staying in the US represents a future full of possibilities for you, while the idea of returning home feels like a setback and a loss of all your hard work. How does this sense of risk and uncertainty about your career and grad school decisions make you feel about your ability to achieve your long-term goals?\nclient: Hey, honestly, it makes me feel pretty anxious and kinda helpless, like no matter what I do, I might not get where I want to be. I just keep doubting if I’m even capable of pulling off what it takes to stay here and build that future.\ntherapist: That must be incredibly difficult to carry on your shoulders, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what it would mean for you to build that future in the US, and what specific aspects of your career and grad school goals feel most daunting?\nclient: Hey, building a future in the US means stability and a chance to grow in a place where I feel I can thrive, you know, like having a real shot at a career and life I’m proud of. The most daunting parts are probably figuring out how to get into grad school with my gaps in skills and the uncertainty of whether any of this will even lead to a job that lets me stay.\ntherapist: It seems like building a future in the US represents a chance for you to grow and thrive, and you're worried that gaps in your skills and job uncertainty might jeopardize that opportunity. Can you share what aspects of your skills you feel are most lacking, and how you think those gaps might impact your grad school and career goals?\nclient: Hey, yeah, I feel like my math and coding skills are just not up to par for something like a Master's in Statistics or Data Science, which seems like the practical path to take. It’s super stressful because without those skills, I’m worried I won’t even get accepted into a program, let alone succeed in it or land a job that helps me stay here.\ntherapist: That's understandable, and it's important to remember that these skills can be developed with practice and dedication. What steps do you think you could take to improve your math and coding abilities, and how might that progress impact your confidence in pursuing your goals?\nclient: Hey, I guess I could look into some online courses or maybe even community college classes to brush up on math and coding, but I’m just not sure if I have the time or money to invest in that right now. It’d probably help me feel a bit more confident if I could get a handle on those skills, though, like I’d at least have a shot at getting into a program.\ntherapist: That's a great start, and it sounds like you're already thinking about potential steps to address those skill gaps. Can you share what you think might be the most feasible options for you, given your current time and financial constraints?\nclient: Hey, I think maybe starting with some free or low-cost online courses could work, like stuff on Coursera or Khan Academy, since I’m already juggling work and don’t have a ton of extra cash. I just worry if that’ll be enough, you know, or if I’ll even have the discipline to stick with it on my own.\ntherapist: Given your current situation, starting with free or low-cost online courses seems like a practical and accessible way to begin addressing those skill gaps. To help you stay motivated and on track, what strategies do you think might work best for you, such as setting aside dedicated time for studying, finding a study buddy, or creating a schedule to follow?\nclient: Hey, I think setting a specific time each week to study, like a couple of hours after work, could help me stay consistent, even if it’s just a little bit at a time.

I hadn’t really thought about how to handle not hearing back, and I can see how that might throw me off if I’m not prepared for it.\n\nI guess I could remind myself that it’s not personal if someone doesn’t reply—maybe they’re just busy or on summer break. I could also keep a list of other labs or profs to reach out to so I don’t feel stuck if a few don’t respond. Do you think that’s a good way to handle it, or is there something else I could do to not let delays mess with my head?\ntherapist: Those strategies sound really helpful, and it's great that you're thinking ahead about how to manage potential setbacks. It might also be useful to focus on the aspects of your plan that are within your control, like dedicating time to learning R and continuing to research labs or professors whose work resonates with you. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and even small steps can contribute to your long-term goals.\nclient: Hey, that makes a lot of sense. Focusing on what I can control, like sticking to my learning schedule and keeping up the search for opportunities, might help me stay grounded even if things don’t move as fast as I’d like.\n\nI’m wondering, though, how do I keep myself from getting too discouraged if I keep hitting dead ends with outreach? Like, I want to stay positive, but I know I can get in my head sometimes if stuff doesn’t pan out. Got any tips for keeping my morale up?\ntherapist: That's a really important consideration, and it's great that you're thinking about how to maintain your positivity even when things don't go as planned. One approach might be to focus on the progress you're making in your learning journey, like mastering new skills in R or GIS, and celebrating those small wins along the way. Additionally, you could remind yourself of why you're pursuing these goals in the first place, and how each step you take brings you closer to your long-term aspirations.\nclient: Hey, I really appreciate that perspective. Reminding myself of the bigger picture and celebrating the small stuff, like getting better at R, could definitely help me stay motivated even if outreach doesn’t go as planned.\n\nI guess I’m also curious about how to balance putting myself out there with not overdoing it. Like, I don’t want to come off as pushy or spam a bunch of profs, but I also don’t want to miss out on chances. Do you have any advice on finding that sweet spot when reaching out?\nclient: Hey, I'm glad you're thinking about striking that balance—it’s definitely something I worry about too. I don’t want to seem annoying, but I also don’t want to hold back too much and miss out on opportunities. What do you think is a good way to approach this without overstepping?","completed":true}
{"id":"tzazpt","timestamp":1649376000000,"category":"academic","concern":"I’m in a History MA program (graduating in May!) and it’s been a big struggle but the worst part is the complete lack of standard expectations.\n\nOver the summer (2021) all of my cohort had to do an internship. At the end of the internship we had to write a reflection essay about our experiences. However, this essay is reviewed by our advisor and depending on what they want the essays are very different. Most were 4-5 pages with a lot of self-reflection, one or two people got away with 1-2 pages. \n\nBut my advisor (who only has me as an advisee as they are on sabbatical) asked for a ten page paper which they have  returned FOUR  times for more editing. This most recent return they are asking me to add at least four paragraphs were I explain some books related to the internship topic, what their main points were, and how I felt those were reflected in my internship. No one else in my cohort was asked to do this but since I need advisor approval I am stuck adding all their demands. I’m the last one still working on this essay.\n\nAlso it needs to be submitted before the 21st so I can graduate so on top of finishing my capstone, regular work for class, and helping a sick family member, I have to work on this stupid essay. My advisor is completely aware of all of this too. And since they are on sabbatical it can be up to a month before I get a response.

I'm really glad you're here. Take your time, and whenever you're ready, share whatever's on your mind—I'm all ears and ready to listen.\nclient: Thanks, thanks for being here. I’ve just been feeling really overwhelmed lately with some academic stuff that’s been weighing on me, and I’m not sure how to handle it all.\ntherapist: That sounds really tough—I can imagine it's exhausting to feel overwhelmed like that. What's been the most challenging part of handling everything?\nclient: Honestly, it’s the constant stress and not being able to shut my brain off that’s been the hardest. I just keep worrying about what’s next, and it’s messing with my sleep and focus big time.\ntherapist: That sounds incredibly draining, and I'm really sorry you're dealing with that. It can be so hard to feel like your mind is always racing, especially when it's affecting your sleep and focus.\nclient: Yeah, it’s just this endless loop of worry that I can’t seem to break out of. I’m trying to manage everything, but it feels like I’m barely keeping my head above water.\ntherapist: It's completely understandable that you'd feel this way, especially when it seems like there's always something else to worry about. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that seem to make this loop of worry worse, or is it more of a constant presence for you?\nclient: Yeah, I think it gets worse when I have quiet moments, like when I’m trying to wind down at night. It’s like my brain just latches onto every little thing I need to do or fix, and I can’t stop it.\ntherapist: That sounds like a really frustrating experience, especially when you're trying to relax and unwind. What would it be like if you could find a way to quiet your mind during those moments, even if just a little?\nclient: Honestly, that would be such a relief, even if it’s just for a bit. I just don’t know how to get there when my thoughts are so loud all the time.\ntherapist: That must feel really overwhelming, especially when you're already so exhausted from managing everything. What if we tried exploring some small, manageable steps that could help quiet those loud thoughts just a little bit, even during those quiet moments?\nclient: Yeah, I’d be up for trying anything at this point, even if it’s just something small to start with. I just feel so drained, you know, and I’m desperate for even a tiny break from all the noise in my head.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you're feeling so desperate for a break from the noise in your head, especially when it seems like the quiet moments only make things worse. Have you ever noticed what happens when you try to focus on something else during those times, like a song, a book, or even just the sensation of your breath?\nclient: Honestly, I haven’t really tried focusing on something specific like that when my mind’s racing. I guess I just get stuck in the spiral and don’t think to switch gears, but I’m willing to give it a shot if it might help even a little.\ntherapist: It's great that you're open to trying something new, even if it seems small. Maybe we could explore a simple technique that might help you focus on something other than your thoughts, like taking a few slow, deep breaths or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground. Would that feel manageable, or would you prefer something else?\nclient: Yeah, I think something simple like focusing on my breathing or feeling my feet on the ground could be doable, especially since it doesn’t feel like a huge task. I’m just hoping it can help pull me out of that mental spiral, even for a minute or two.\ntherapist: What if we tried combining a few of these simple techniques to create a short routine that you can turn to during those overwhelming moments? For instance, you could take a few slow, deep breaths while focusing on the sensation of your feet on the ground. Or maybe you could try counting backward from 10 while gently squeezing and releasing your hands. Which of these combinations feels most doable for you?\nclient: Honestly, I think combining the breathing with focusing on my feet sounds the most doable right now. It feels pretty straightforward, and I can probably manage that even when I’m feeling overwhelmed.\ntherapist: That sounds like a great choice, and I'm glad you're feeling hopeful about it. Let's build on that by creating a simple plan for when you feel overwhelmed. We can start by setting a specific goal, like practicing this technique for 2 minutes each day, and then gradually increase the duration as it becomes more comfortable. To help you stay on track, we could also identify a specific time of day or situation when you'll practice this technique, such as right before bed or during your lunch break. What do you think about that?\nclient: Yeah, I think having a little plan like that could really help me stay on track, especially since my days feel so chaotic. Setting aside just 2 minutes, maybe right before bed since that’s when my mind’s usually racing the most, sounds pretty manageable to me.\ntherapist: That's a solid plan, and I'm glad we've identified a manageable starting point. It's also important to anticipate potential barriers and come up with strategies to overcome them. For example, if you find it difficult to remember to practice your technique before bed, we could set a reminder on your phone or place a note on your nightstand.

{"id":"yvmofn","timestamp":1668470400000,"category":"academic","concern":"Hi all,\n\nI am an MBA student in the back half of my program with 4 classes left. I am in the second most challenging class in the degree supposedly at the moment, and while it is a lot of work it didn't seem tough when given the time at the beginning of the semester. The issue is, I haven't been able to put the time in to succeed and it is really hitting me mentally, I can't decide what to do at the moment. \n\nI recently lost both my great aunt and uncle (basically my grandparents, the closest people in my life outside of my immediate family) within two weeks of each other and have had to travel across the USA to support my family and be there as my aunt passed away at the end. For reference, my aunt and uncle lived in the northeast while my family is located in southern FL. My immediate family is extremely close and my mother has been away from the family providing care every step of the way in conjunction with Hospice, not leaving their side since her arrival there in early September. On top of this, my maternal grandparents and maternal uncle (who have been mentally abusive of my mother for my entire life, the reason we moved down south) have been treating the family terribly and causing additional stress for my family and quite frankly I don't know how my mother has been able to deal with this whole thing. My uncle is a troublemaker who has been enabled throughout his life by my grandparents and has been to jail a few times for various issues that should have landed him more time in lockup. The conflict this time is over the fact certain people were not included in the will, and my mom is being blamed for us having control of the estate. We had a bat by the door the whole time we were at my great aunt and uncle's house and all decided nobody is leaving mom alone and we needed to be ready in case he showed up to cause issues. \n\nI say all this to mention that while I stayed there (4 weeks) from the beginning of October to a few days ago, I had no access to the internet on the trip minus randomly stopping at a local community college to try and do some work one day for class. Essentially every waking moment I was there I was with the family and trying to provide support for my mom, and I lost track of this class and got so far behind that I feel like I can't claw my way back at this point. I can drop the course, but I feel as if I am an abject failure for doing so. I thought about dropping earlier in the trip but figured I'd be able to get back on track when we left, but we stayed longer than anticipated and I feel as if that isn't the case.\n\n I'm 26 and feel like I should be done with my degree already, I don't want to put myself back by a semester when I am nearing the finish line, but I'm not sure what to do. I haven't completely coped with the situation to this point and am just looking for some insights or perspective on this. I am planning on having a conversation over the phone with my professor on Thursday, and my advisor has mentioned I can get out of the class affecting my degree given the circumstances. It still just makes me feel like I'm screwing myself so hard and wasting time. \n\nSorry for being long-winded. \n\nGot any ways to deal with the guilt of potentially dropping a class, and have any advice?","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome to our session today!

Is there anything specific you could do to ease into the project and start contributing without feeling like you need to catch up on everything at once?\nclient: client: I guess I could maybe just reach out to one of my teammates and ask for a quick rundown of where things are at, without trying to take on everything right away. I’m just worried they might think I’ve been slacking, you know, and I don’t even know how to explain everything that’s been going on without it sounding like an excuse.\ntherapist: That's a really good idea to start by reaching out to a teammate for a quick update. Remember, you don't have to explain everything or justify your situation to them. You could say something like, 'Hey, I'm sorry I've been out of the loop lately. I'm trying to get back on track and I'd really appreciate a quick rundown of where things are at.' That way, you're taking responsibility for your absence without feeling like you have to over-explain.\nclient: client: Thanks, that actually sounds doable. I’ll try reaching out like that and just keep it simple, see how it goes from there. I’m still kinda stressed about how far behind I am overall, though, not just with the project. Like, even if I get back into this, I’m not sure I can handle the rest of the workload right now.\ntherapist: It's understandable to feel stressed about the overall workload, especially after being away for a while. Remember that taking small steps towards catching up, like reaching out to your teammate, can help build momentum and reduce feelings of overwhelm. Have you thought about what other small steps you could take to ease back into your coursework?\nclient: client: Honestly, I haven’t really figured out any other steps yet; I’m just kinda stuck on feeling like it’s all too much to even start. Maybe I could break things down into smaller chunks or something, but I’m not sure where to begin with that.\ntherapist: Breaking things down into smaller, manageable chunks can be a great way to start tackling the workload. One option might be to make a list of all the tasks you need to complete and then prioritize them based on importance and urgency. Another approach could be to set aside dedicated blocks of time each day or week to focus on specific tasks, so you're not trying to do everything at once. You could also consider reaching out to your professors or a campus support service for additional guidance and resources. What do you think might work best for you?\nclient: client: I think making a list and prioritizing stuff could help, like just seeing it all laid out might make it less overwhelming. I’m not sure about the time blocks yet, but maybe I’ll try talking to my professor during our call to get a better idea of what’s most urgent.\nclient: Cool, I’m glad you think the list idea could work for getting a handle on things. Do you have any tips on how to not get totally stressed out while I’m figuring out what to prioritize?\nclient: Thanks for the suggestion about making a list; I think it’ll really help me get a clearer picture. Do you have any quick tips for staying calm while I sort through everything and decide what to tackle first?\nclient: I’m really glad you think the list will help clear things up. One quick tip for staying calm is to take short breaks when you feel your stress building—maybe step away for a few minutes, breathe deeply, or grab a quick snack to reset. How do you usually handle moments when you’re feeling overwhelmed?\nclient: Hey, thanks for the tip about taking short breaks—that sounds like something I can definitely try. I usually just push through when I’m overwhelmed, but I’m starting to see that might not be the best way, so I’m curious if there’s anything else you’d suggest for keeping my head clear?\nclient: Thanks for the suggestion about breaks; I’m definitely gonna give that a shot since pushing through hasn’t been working so well. Do you have any other ideas for staying grounded when things start piling up?\nclient: Thanks for the ideas; I’m really open to trying anything that might help me stay balanced. Do you think something like a quick mindfulness exercise could work, or is there another trick you’ve seen help in situations like this?\nclient: Thanks for being open to these suggestions; I’m glad you’re willing to experiment with what might work. I think a quick mindfulness exercise could be a great idea—do you have any experience with that, or would you want some guidance on how to start?\nclient: Thanks for the suggestion about mindfulness; I’m definitely interested in giving it a shot. I don’t have much experience with it, so I’d appreciate any guidance on how to get started.\nclient: Hey, I’m really glad you’re open to helping me with this mindfulness stuff. Could you maybe walk me through a simple exercise or point me to some resources to get started?\nclient: Hey, I’m really grateful for your help with this mindfulness idea. Could you share a quick exercise or maybe recommend an app or video to guide me through the basics?\nclient: Hey, thanks for the ideas on mindfulness exercises and resources; I’m excited to try them out. Do you think starting with just a few minutes a day could still make a difference, or should I aim for longer sessions right away?\nclient: Thanks for the input on starting small with mindfulness; I think that sounds manageable. Do you have any tips on how to build it into a routine without feeling overwhelmed?\nclient: Hey, I’m really glad we’re figuring this out together. Do you have any advice on making mindfulness a regular thing without it feeling like just another task on my to-do list?","completed":false}
{"id":"sd6mlv","timestamp":1643155200000,"category":"emotional","concern":"It has been about 4.5 years since I graduated my PhD program and it still feels like it happened last year. I know that everyone has a different grad school experience but I definitely had some of the lowest moments \nof my life (along with a few of the best ones too). I wanted to post this because I wasn't sure if it might be relatable to some of you who are currently in a PhD\/masters program or recently graduated. Its not easy to share something intimate like this but if it helps someone then it is worth it. \n\nThis year, my wife and I did some soul searching and met with a mental health professional to work on understanding ourselves more and improving the quality of our relationship together. Through this experience I was able to understand how my experience in grad school shaped how I acted in my day to day life. I think the constant pressure of presenting positive results, delivering flawless presentations\/talks, mastering techniques, etc. in grad school can drive us to an unhealthy self-image of always needing to be always perfect. At least it did for me. Understanding, being comfortable with and even being happy with my imperfections has really helped me overcome this perfection complex.\n\nThe point of this post is just to say that there will always be failures, always be imperfections, and always be mistakes and that is ok. Grad school isn't easy and mistakes don't make you any less valuable as a person or a researcher. You are all valuable and amazing just the way you are no matter how many times things get messed up. Even if you don't believe that yet, I can say that I do and that is at least one person that believes in you. I know this might not resonate with everyone but I hope it did with someone.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome to our session today!

I'm so glad you're here, and I'm excited to learn more about what's been on your mind lately. Please feel free to share whatever thoughts or concerns you'd like to discuss, and I'll do my best to listen attentively and offer support.\nclient: Thanks for having me, I’m really glad to be here too. I’ve been feeling pretty overwhelmed lately and just wanted to talk through some of the stuff that’s been weighing on me.\ntherapist: I'm really glad you're here, and I'm so sorry to hear you've been feeling overwhelmed lately. That sounds really tough—I can imagine how heavy that weight must feel. Is there anything in particular that's been contributing to that sense of overwhelm, or would you like to share more about what's been going on?\nclient: Thanks for understanding, it does feel pretty heavy sometimes. I guess I’ve just been noticing how stressed I am all the time, and I’m not even sure why it’s hitting me so hard.\n\nMan, I don’t know where to start. Like, I got this Apple Watch recently, and it’s showing my heart rate is always super high, my shoulders are constantly tight, and I’ve got these headaches that just won’t quit. I’m wondering if this is just part of the PhD grind or if something’s really off with me. Do you think this is normal, or should I be worried?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're going through a lot, and it's completely understandable to feel uncertain about whether these symptoms are normal or something to be concerned about. It's great that you're paying attention to your body's signals and wanting to understand what's going on. Let's take a moment to unpack these symptoms a bit more, and I'll do my best to help you make sense of them.\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate you taking the time to help me figure this out. I’m just kinda lost on whether this is just the stress of grad school or if my body’s trying to tell me something more serious.\n\nHonestly, I’m so used to pushing through stuff, but seeing these numbers and feeling this way all the time is freaking me out a bit. Like, am I just overreacting, or should I be doing something about it?\ntherapist: It's understandable that you're feeling a bit lost and unsure of how to proceed. It sounds like you're caught between your usual coping mechanism of pushing through and your growing concern about these physical symptoms. Can you tell me more about what it would mean to you if these symptoms were more than just the stress of grad school?\nclient: Thanks for getting that, I’m definitely torn between just keeping on and actually dealing with this. If these symptoms turn out to be more than just grad school stress, I guess it’d mean I’ve been ignoring something bigger, and that scares me—like, what if I’ve been messing up my health without even realizing it?\ntherapist: I hear you, and that's a really valid fear. It's understandable that you're worried about the possibility of neglecting your health. What if we explored what it would be like to start paying closer attention to your body's signals, and what steps you could take to address them?\nclient: Thanks, I’d really like to figure out how to listen to my body better. I mean, I’ve been so caught up in deadlines and research that I just ignore everything else, you know?\n\nI guess I’m worried that if I start focusing on this stuff, I’ll fall behind or won’t be able to handle everything on my plate. How do people even balance all this without totally losing it?\ntherapist: You're clearly putting in a lot of effort to balance everything, and it's natural to worry about how adding more to your plate might impact your progress. What if we focused on finding small, manageable ways to tune into your body's signals without feeling like you're adding another huge task to your list?\nclient: Thanks, that sounds doable, I think. I’m just so used to everything feeling like a giant burden, so starting small might actually help without freaking me out more.\n\nHonestly, I don’t even know where to begin with this—like, do I just take more breaks or what? I feel kinda clueless about how to not let this stress mess me up even more.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the thought of adding something new to your routine, and that's totally understandable. Maybe we could start by exploring some small changes you could make, like taking a few minutes each day to check in with your body and notice how you're feeling, or finding ways to take short breaks throughout the day to give yourself a chance to reset.\nclient: Thanks, that makes sense, and I think I can manage a few minutes here and there to just kinda check in with myself. I’m just worried I’ll forget or push it aside when things get hectic, you know?\n\nLike, I want to try this, but my brain’s always racing with to-do lists and deadlines. How do I even make space for this without feeling like I’m slacking off?\ntherapist: One idea could be to tie these small check-ins to something you already do daily, like right after your morning coffee or before starting work. That way, it becomes a part of your routine without needing extra mental energy. And if your brain starts racing about deadlines, maybe gently remind yourself that taking a moment to reset isn't slacking off—it's actually giving you more clarity and energy to tackle your work.\nclient: Thanks, I like the idea of tying it to something I already do, like after coffee—that feels less like an extra thing to stress about.

I’m inexperienced in molecular cloning, but I’m now on my twelfth (!) attempt and I’m feeling very down and it’s hard not to take it to heart. \n\nI’ve made various mistakes along the way. Once, on attempt 9 I did something truly stupid (wrong antibiotic lol) but I caught and fixed it quickly and it just took a few extra hours. Once we ran out of a key reagent because someone left an empty tube in a box and never ordered more (it was difficult to see it was empty before I thawed it) so I had to start over. Another time the undergrad intern used all 30 vials of the bacteria I needed the morning I needed them, without informing anyone. So my fault for only checking the freezer the morning of the experiment and not immediately before starting, but also in my opinion this is a broader lab organization issue. The other times were issues by relying on protocols that were not well-optimized for my project (par for the course I guess). The latest is that I now need to re-design most of my strategy as I was following the instructions of someone who did a cloning project with the same backbone only to find that their instructions were incorrect and ignored a key gene in the vector. This is something I feel awful for not catching sooner in hindsight but again, I am inexperienced so it did not jump out to me until my PI finally noticed it today. \n\nI’m not repeating the same mistakes but the sheer number of mistakes on the same step of a project is making me feel like I’m the problem. It’s driving me crazy and I keep going back and forth on how much of it is my fault or just unfortunate.\n\nTLDR: How do you guys handle the kind of mistakes where you don’t know what you can do better except gain knowledge and experience over time?

I’ve just been really struggling with a project at my lab, and it’s got me feeling pretty down about myself and my abilities.\ntherapist: That sounds really tough, and I can imagine how frustrating and discouraging it must feel to be stuck in this situation. Can you tell me more about what's been challenging with the project and how it's been affecting you?\nclient: Yeah, it’s just been a constant cycle of setbacks with this project, and it’s really hitting my confidence hard. I keep wondering if I’m just not cut out for this kind of work, even though I know deep down I’m still learning.\n\nI guess I’m just trying to figure out how to not let every little mistake feel like a personal failure, you know? Like, I want to keep pushing forward, but it’s exhausting feeling like I’m always messing up. How do people deal with that kind of frustration without losing it?\ntherapist: It's really brave of you to share that, and I can hear how much this situation has been weighing on you. You mentioned wanting to keep pushing forward, but it's exhausting to feel like you're always messing up—can you tell me more about what keeps you going despite the frustration?\nclient: Thanks for saying that, it helps to hear I’m not totally off base for feeling this way. I guess what keeps me going is just not wanting to let my PI or myself down, and knowing that if I can just get past this hurdle, it’ll be a huge step forward in my skills and my project.\ntherapist: That's a really powerful motivation, and it shows how much you care about your work and your growth. It sounds like there's a part of you that still believes in your ability to push through and come out stronger on the other side—even if it doesn't always feel that way in the moment. Can you tell me more about what that belief looks like when you're feeling less overwhelmed?\nclient: Yeah, I appreciate that perspective. When I’m not totally buried under the frustration, that belief kinda feels like a quiet reminder that I’ve made it this far, you know, through undergrad and getting into grad school, so I must have something going for me even if I can’t see it right now.\ntherapist: That quiet reminder sounds like a powerful ally, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. It's interesting how your belief in yourself is rooted in your past successes, even if they're not always at the forefront of your mind. Can you think of any ways to nurture that belief when you're in the thick of frustration, so it can be a louder voice guiding you forward?\nclient: Thanks, that’s a good way to frame it. I guess maybe I could try jotting down a quick note or something about a past win, like getting into this program or even a small lab success, and keep it somewhere visible to remind myself I’ve got this, even on the rough days.\ntherapist: That sounds like a thoughtful strategy to keep your quiet reminder front and center. Have you ever tried something similar before, or is this a new approach for you?\nclient: Thanks for the encouragement. I haven’t really done something like this before, so it’s kinda new territory, but I’m willing to give it a shot since I need all the positive vibes I can get right now.\ntherapist: It’s great to see you embracing this new approach, and I can sense your willingness to explore different strategies.

{"id":"seeu31","timestamp":1643328000000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"I'm in a MA program right now and we just started in-person learning. Until this week, I had been at my parents' house doing online school from there. While I'm definitely not the biggest proponent of online school, I was actually really enjoying life at home. I got to focus on doing readings and work without worrying about maintaining my own living space, I didn't have a commute to and from classes, and I really enjoyed hanging out with my family every day. Now I'm in a different city which is still pretty shut down from the pandemic, living alone, I can't see anyone, I haven't been able to focus on my coursework that much, and I just feel really *lonely* especially since the people in my cohort aren't keen on getting together due to the pandemic. Even though I absolutely love my program and what I'm studying, I'm starting to question if it's worth the lifestyle choices that are necessary (e.g., moving away from home, the job search being global rather than local). Now, I'm finding myself wishing the weeks would pass until I can go back during the break. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way and how they cope with it. I'm also wondering if moving away for grad school is that much better if there weren't a pandemic shutting everything down\/limiting any social activities; especially since so many people refer to grad school as an isolating experience anyway.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello there, I'm so glad you've taken this time for yourself.

Please feel free to share whatever is on your mind, and I'll be here to listen and support you every step of the way.\nclient: Thanks for being here to listen. I’ve just been really struggling with the transition back to in-person learning and being away from home, and I’m feeling pretty isolated and unsure if this is all worth it.\ntherapist: It's understandable to feel this way, especially after adjusting to a new environment and being away from home. It's important to recognize that your feelings are valid, and I'm here to listen and support you as we navigate this transition together.\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate that. I guess I’m just trying to figure out if this loneliness and doubt are just part of the grad school experience or if I’m missing something by being so far from my support system. Like, I love what I’m studying, but being here alone in a new city with everything still kinda shut down—it’s just hard, you know? I keep wondering if I’d feel different if things were more normal, or if this is just how it’s gonna be no matter what.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're caught between your passion for your studies and the weight of being so far from your support system, especially during such a challenging time. It's natural to wonder if things would feel different under more normal circumstances, and I'm here to help you explore these feelings and figure out what might help you feel more connected and grounded.\nclient: Thanks for understanding where I’m coming from. I just feel so torn, you know, because I don’t want to give up on something I’m passionate about, but at the same time, I’m struggling to find a balance with feeling so alone all the time. Like, I keep asking myself if there’s a way to make this work without feeling like I’m sacrificing so much of my happiness. What do you think—how can I start to feel more okay with being here, or at least less overwhelmed by it all?\ntherapist: It's clear that your passion for your studies is an important part of your life, and it's understandable that you're hesitant to give up on something that means so much to you. At the same time, it's important to prioritize your happiness and well-being, especially during this challenging transition. I'm here to help you explore ways to find a balance that works for you and to identify steps you can take to feel more connected and grounded in your new environment.\nclient: Thanks, I really appreciate that perspective. I want to make this work, but I’m just not sure where to start with finding that balance.\n\nUgh, I don’t know, I guess I’m just feeling stuck. Like, I try to focus on my readings or assignments, but my mind keeps wandering to how much I miss being at home with my family, or even just having someone to chat with casually. I’ve thought about reaching out to people in my cohort more, but everyone seems so cautious about meeting up, and I get it, but it just adds to the loneliness. Do you have any ideas on how I can maybe build some kind of connection here, even if it’s small, without pushing past people’s comfort zones? And honestly, I’m still wondering if this whole grad school thing is supposed to feel this hard, or if I’m just not cut out for being so far away.\ntherapist: You're not alone in feeling this way, and it's important to remember that your desire for connection and balance is completely valid. Let's explore some small steps you could take to build connections in your new environment, while respecting the boundaries of those around you. Perhaps starting with virtual meetups or online study groups could be a gentle way to begin forming connections. What do you think?\nclient: Thanks for suggesting that. I think virtual meetups or online study groups could be a good starting point, especially since people seem more comfortable with that right now. I guess I’ve been hesitant to even try that because I’m worried it won’t feel like enough, you know, like it won’t really fill that gap of missing real, in-person connection. But maybe it’s better than nothing. Have you seen other students make that work, or do you have any tips on how to make those online interactions feel a bit more meaningful? And I’m still kinda wrestling with whether this level of struggle is just part of grad school or if I’m making it harder on myself by being so far from home.\ntherapist: It's great that you're considering virtual options as a starting point. Many students have found success in building meaningful connections through online platforms, even if it doesn't replicate the full experience of in-person interaction. One tip might be to try video calls instead of just text-based communication, as seeing someone's face can add a bit of warmth and closeness. As for the struggle of grad school, it's normal to feel overwhelmed, but your distance from home could definitely be amplifying those feelings. It might be helpful to reflect on what aspects of grad school you're enjoying and which ones feel particularly challenging right now.\nclient: Thanks for the suggestion about video calls; I think seeing people’s faces could definitely make a difference, even if it’s not the same as being there in person. I’ll try to set up something small, like a casual chat or study session over Zoom, and see how it feels.\n\nHonestly, I do love parts of grad school—like diving into the material and the discussions when they happen—but the isolation and being so far from my support system are just weighing on me a ton. I keep wondering if I’d feel this way even without the pandemic, or if it’s just the circumstances making everything harder. Do you think it’s possible to figure out if this is just a temporary rough patch, or if maybe grad school away from home isn’t the right fit for me long-term? I don’t want to make a rash decision, but I also don’t want to keep pushing through if it’s not sustainable, you know?\ntherapist: It's understandable to question whether this is a temporary challenge or a sign that grad school away from home might not be the right fit for you long-term. One way to approach this could be to set a specific time frame, say a few months, to focus on implementing the small steps we've discussed—like virtual meetups and prioritizing the aspects of grad school you enjoy—while also keeping a journal to track how you feel over time. This could help you gain clarity on whether the difficulties you're facing are situational or more deeply rooted.\nclient: Thanks for that idea. Setting a time frame and journaling my feelings sounds like a practical way to figure out what’s really going on with me, without jumping to any quick conclusions.\n\nI guess I’m just still kinda nervous about whether I’ll be able to tell the difference between a rough patch and something bigger, you know? Like, what if I keep feeling this way even after trying these steps? Do you think there are specific things I should look out for in my journaling to help me see if this is just temporary or if I need to rethink my whole plan? And honestly, I’m still worried that even if I make some connections here, it won’t be enough to make up for being so far from my family.\ntherapist: You’re raising some important questions, and it’s great that you’re thinking through this so carefully. When journaling, you might want to pay attention to patterns—like whether there are specific situations or times when your feelings of isolation or frustration feel more manageable, or whether there are particular moments where you feel more connected. Also, noticing how you feel after taking those small steps, like setting up virtual meetups, could give you some clues about whether those efforts are helping. And about being far from family, it might be helpful to reflect on what aspects of their support you’re missing most—whether it’s emotional, practical, or something else—and see if there are ways to replicate or adapt that support here, even if it’s not the same.\nclient: Thanks for breaking it down like that. I think focusing on specific patterns and how I feel after trying stuff like virtual meetups could really help me get a clearer picture.\n\nHonestly, I’m still kinda stuck on this whole family thing, you know? Like, I miss just having them around for the little stuff—eating dinner together, chatting about random things, just feeling like I’m not so on my own. I’m not sure if there’s a way to recreate that here, especially with everything still so locked down. Do you think there’s anything I can do to kinda bridge that gap, even just a little, while I’m so far away? And I guess I’m also wondering if this feeling of missing them so much is gonna stick with me no matter what, or if it might get easier over time.\nclient: Thanks for the suggestions on journaling and reflecting on what I’m missing most from family. I’ll definitely try to pinpoint those specific things and see if I can find small ways to fill that gap.\n\nI’m just still feeling pretty unsure about whether this longing for home will ever really fade, you know? Like, I want to make this work, but it’s hard to imagine feeling settled when I’m missing those everyday moments with my family so much. Do you think there’s a way to balance staying connected with them while still building something meaningful here, even if it feels so different? I guess I’m just trying to figure out how to not feel so split between two worlds all the time.\nclient: Thanks for the ideas on balancing things. I’ll try to think about ways to stay connected with my family while also building something here, even if it feels tricky right now.\n\nI guess I’m just still worried about feeling so torn, you know? Like, I want to commit to this grad school journey, but my heart’s kinda half at home. Do you have any thoughts on how I can start to feel more whole, or at least less pulled in two directions, while I’m figuring this out?\nclient: Thanks for the input. I’m glad to have some ideas to work with on staying connected and building something here.\n\nI’m still feeling pretty split, though, you know? Like, I want to dive into this grad school thing, but part of me is always thinking about home. Do you have any tips on how I can start feeling a bit more grounded here, even with that pull still there?\nclient: Thanks for the advice. I’ll definitely give those ideas a shot to help me feel more settled.\n\nI guess I’m just still wondering how long it might take to feel like I really belong here, you know? Like, is there anything else I can do to make this place start feeling a bit more like home while I’m working through these feelings?\nclient: Thanks for the guidance. I’ll keep working on those suggestions to help me feel more at ease here.\n\nI’m still kinda curious, though, about how others in similar situations have handled this, you know? Like, do you have any general insights or stories about how people far from home eventually find their footing, even if it takes time?\nclient: Thanks for sharing that curiosity. I’m glad you’re open to hearing about how others have navigated this, and I’ll definitely think about some examples or insights that might resonate with you.\n\nBefore we wrap up, I just want to check in—do you feel like we’ve covered the main things on your mind today, or is there anything else you’d like to touch on briefly?\nclient: Thanks for checking in. I think we’ve hit the main stuff I was wrestling with today, but I appreciate the space to talk it out—maybe next time we can dive a bit deeper into some of those examples if I’m still feeling stuck.\nclient: No problem, I’m glad we could cover what’s been on your mind. I’m definitely up for exploring those examples more next time if you’re still feeling stuck.\nclient: Cool, I’m looking forward to digging into that next time. Thanks again for today—it’s been really helpful to get this off my chest.\nclient: No worries, I’m glad today felt helpful. I’ll see you next time, and we’ll pick up where we left off.\nclient: Sounds good, I appreciate you making time for me. I’ll see you next time and we’ll keep the conversation going.\nclient: Thanks, I’m really glad we had this chance to talk. I’ll catch you at our next session!\nclient: Thanks, I’m glad we got to talk today too. I’ll see you at our next session!","completed":false}

I guess my next worry is how to even find roommates outside my program who’d be a good fit. Like, I don’t wanna end up with people who party all the time or don’t respect my need for quiet study time. How do I go about finding folks who’ll mesh with my lifestyle when I’m new to the city and don’t know anyone yet?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're making progress in weighing your options. You mentioned that finding roommates outside your program who respect your study habits and lifestyle is a concern. One strategy might be to join local community groups or clubs related to your interests, or look for roommates through online platforms that allow you to filter by lifestyle preferences. Have you considered reaching out to your university for help with finding roommates, as they might have resources or recommendations for students in similar situations?\nclient: Client: Yeah, I hadn’t really thought about using university resources for finding roommates, but that sounds like a solid starting point. I’m just a bit nervous about how to make sure we’re on the same page lifestyle-wise, you know, like actually talking about expectations before signing a lease. What’s the best way to bring up stuff like study schedules or noise levels without sounding too uptight or weird? I don’t want to scare off potential roommates right off the bat.\nclient: Therapist: That’s a really valid concern, and it shows you’re thinking ahead about compatibility. One way to approach it could be to frame those conversations casually, like asking about their daily routines or what they’re looking for in a living situation, so it feels more like a natural chat than a checklist—maybe even meet up for coffee to get a sense of their vibe. What do you think about starting with a low-pressure convo like that?\n\nClient: Yeah, I can see that working—keeping it casual like just getting to know them over coffee sounds way less intimidating. I guess I’ll try that and see how it feels, though I’m still a little worried I won’t pick up on red flags right away.","completed":true}

In the time since the last admissions round, I've signed a deal with a publisher to publish my MA thesis as a book, which is due out in June, but hasn't been listed for pre-order or sale anywhere yet to prove that it's real to admission committees and not just a CV invention, so I'm worried that won't be enough to give me a leg up in admissions. My MA GPA was a 4.0, but my undergrad GPA was absolutely awful. \n\nI have received one email from a member of an admissions committee from one of the schools I applied to asking whether \"the retirement of \\[a professor I had expressed interest in working in\\] would affect whether or not you choose to attend\" that school. \n\nAm I panicking unnecessarily?

Please feel free to share whatever is on your mind, and I'll be here to listen and support you. What would you like to talk about today?\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here. I’m just really stressed about my PhD applications and whether I’ll get in anywhere, on top of feeling stuck with no job and no clear path forward.\ntherapist: That sounds incredibly overwhelming, and I can understand why you'd feel so stuck. It's tough to balance the pressure of PhD applications with the uncertainty of your current situation. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been on your mind lately, and how you've been coping with all of this?\nclient: Honestly, I’ve been overthinking every little detail about my applications, like whether my upcoming book will even matter to admissions committees since it’s not out yet. I’m also just feeling kinda useless with no job, and I’m worried I’m wasting time waiting to hear back.\n\nMan, I don’t even know where to start sometimes. Like, I keep checking my email every five minutes for updates, even though I know decisions won’t come until March. And that one email from the admissions committee about the professor retiring—does that mean I’m in, or are they just fishing for info? I’m driving myself nuts, and I don’t know how to just chill out about it. Got any tips for shutting my brain off for a bit?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're caught up in a whirlwind of uncertainty, and it's no wonder you're feeling stuck and overwhelmed. I can imagine how stressful it must be to constantly question every detail of your applications and feel like you're not moving forward. It's understandable that you'd be checking your email constantly for updates, even if you know decisions won't come until March.\nclient: therapist: Checking emails obsessively and overanalyzing that message about the professor retiring can really amplify your anxiety, and it’s important to find ways to step back. Have you tried any strategies to give yourself a mental break, like setting specific times to check your email or engaging in activities that help you disconnect from these worries?\n\nclient: Nah, I haven’t really tried anything specific like that. I mean, I’ve thought about maybe limiting email checks, but I’m kinda scared I’ll miss something important, you know? And honestly, I don’t even know what I’d do to distract myself—everything feels like it circles back to stressing about my future. Got any ideas for stuff that might actually help me unplug for a bit?\ntherapist: It's completely understandable that you'd feel anxious about potentially missing something important, and I can see how everything seems to loop back to your stress about the future. One idea could be to try setting a specific time each day to check your emails, so you can give yourself permission to step away from it the rest of the time. As for activities to help you unplug, have you considered something like taking a short walk, listening to calming music, or engaging in a creative hobby that you enjoy?\nclient: Yeah, I get the logic behind setting a specific time to check emails, but I’m worried I’ll just obsess over it until that time comes anyway. I haven’t done much in the way of hobbies lately—maybe a walk could help, though I’m not sure if I can get my mind off things even then. What do you think about something like journaling or just dumping all my thoughts out—would that help, or would it just make me overthink even more?\ntherapist: Journaling can be a helpful way to process your thoughts and emotions, as long as you approach it with a non-judgmental mindset. By writing down your thoughts and feelings without trying to analyze or solve everything, you might find it easier to step back from the whirlwind of uncertainty and gain some clarity. If you're concerned about overthinking, you could try setting a time limit for journaling or using a prompt like \"\"Today, I'm feeling...\"\" to guide your writing. Would you be open to giving it a try, even just for a few minutes each day?\nclient: Yeah, I’m willing to give journaling a shot, even if it’s just for a few minutes. I like the idea of a prompt to keep me from spiraling too much—maybe it’ll help get some of this mess out of my head. Do you think I should, like, write about specific stuff each day, or just whatever’s bugging me at the moment? And honestly, if it doesn’t work and I still feel stuck, what else could I try to just… I don’t know, feel less like I’m drowning in all this waiting and worrying?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're really open to finding ways to manage your stress and anxiety, which is a great first step. As for journaling, you could start by writing about whatever's on your mind that day—just let your thoughts flow without worrying too much about structure or coherence. If you find that's not working for you, you could try focusing on specific themes, like your goals or the things you're grateful for. And remember, there are lots of other things you could try if journaling doesn't work for you—maybe some deep breathing exercises, meditation, or even talking to a friend or family member about how you're feeling.\nclient: Cool, I appreciate the flexibility with the journaling approach—starting with whatever’s on my mind feels less intimidating than having a set topic. I’m curious about the deep breathing or meditation stuff you mentioned; I’ve never really tried that before, and I’m not sure if I’d just sit there feeling silly or if it’d actually help calm me down—can you walk me through how to even start with something like that?\ntherapist: That’s a great question, and it’s totally normal to feel a bit unsure about trying something new, especially when you’re already feeling overwhelmed. Deep breathing exercises can be a great way to start, since they’re simple and you can do them anywhere. One technique is called box breathing: you breathe in for four counts, hold it for four counts, breathe out for four counts, and hold again for four counts. It can help slow down your heart rate and give your mind a chance to catch up. If you’re feeling up to it, we can try it together right now, just for a minute or two.\nclient: **Client:** Hey, yeah, I'm down to try this box breathing thing with you right now—sounds pretty straightforward, and I could use something to slow down the chaos in my head. Walk me through it step by step, and, like, if I mess up or feel weird, is that okay, or should I be getting it right off the bat?\ntherapist: Of course, it's totally okay if it feels a bit awkward at first—just breathe however feels natural and comfortable, and don't worry about getting it 'perfect'. Let's start with a few rounds together: breathe in slowly through your nose for four counts, hold that breath for four counts, then exhale slowly through your mouth for four counts, and pause again for four counts. Ready when you are.\nclient: **Client:** Alright, I’m ready to give it a shot. Let’s do this together—count me through it, and I’ll follow along, even if I feel a bit off at first.\ntherapist: You're doing great—just keep that slow, steady rhythm. Let's start with the first round: breathe in through your nose for four counts... one... two... three... four. Hold that breath for four counts... one... two... three... four. Now exhale through your mouth for four counts... one... two... three... four. And hold again for four counts... one... two... three... four. Ready for the next round?\nclient: **Client:** Yeah, I'm ready for the next round—let's keep going. That first one felt a little strange, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of it, so just keep counting me through a couple more if that’s cool.\ntherapist: You're doing fantastic—your rhythm is smoothing out already! Let's keep going: breathe in through your nose for four counts... one... two... three... four. Hold that breath for four counts... one... two... three... four. Now exhale through your mouth for four counts... one... two... three... four. And hold again for four counts... one... two... three... four. One more round?\nclient: **Client:** Yeah, let’s do one more round—I’m feeling a bit calmer already, which is kinda surprising. Keep counting me through it, and maybe after this, we can chat about how to use this when I’m spiraling over the PhD stuff again.\ntherapist: Absolutely, I'm glad to hear you're feeling calmer. Let's move through one more round together, and after that, we can certainly talk about how to incorporate this technique when you're feeling overwhelmed about your PhD work. Ready for the final round? Breathe in through your nose for four counts... one... two... three... four. Hold that breath for four counts... one... two... three... four. Now exhale through your mouth for four counts... one... two... three... four. And hold again for four counts... one... two... three... four. Great job! Let's discuss how to use this technique to help you feel more centered when stress creeps in.\nclient: **Client:** Thanks, that last round really helped settle me down some more—I didn’t expect it to work this fast. So, like, how do I pull this out when I’m freaking out over PhD apps or whatever, especially when I’m just sitting at home alone overthinking everything?\ntherapist: Let's start by thinking about specific moments when the PhD stress kicks in—like when you're staring at application deadlines or scrolling through university websites. What if we practice the 4-4-4 breathing now, and I guide you through it like this: \"When you feel that spiral starting, take a breath in for four counts... hold it... and slowly exhale for four, letting the tension melt with each count.\" Would you like to try that together?\nclient: **Client:** Yeah, that sounds like a good idea—I'm definitely down to try it. Like, I know those moments hit hard when I’m just refreshing my email for updates or overanalyzing every word in my application, so let’s practice now while I’m still feeling kinda okay.\ntherapist: Let's practice the 4-4-4 breathing technique right now, tailored to those specific moments of stress. I'll guide you through it, and you can imagine yourself in one of those situations, like refreshing your email or overanalyzing your application. Ready? Breathe in through your nose for four counts... one... two... three... four. Hold that breath for four counts... one... two... three... four. Now exhale through your mouth for four counts... one... two... three... four. And hold again for four counts... one... two... three... four. How did that feel, especially imagining those moments?\nclient: **Client:** That felt pretty good, honestly—I could kinda picture myself in that email-refreshing spiral, and the breathing helped pull me back a bit. So, like, should I just do this every time I catch myself stressing, or is there a way to, I dunno, make it a habit before I even get to that point?\ntherapist: That's a great question. Building it into your routine—like before starting your PhD work or even during short breaks—could help prevent stress from building up. Maybe we could also brainstorm a few other ways to integrate this breathing technique into your daily life, like pairing it with something you already do, such as when you first sit down at your desk or right after you've finished a task.

I was accepted to the University of Utah BME PhD program (by some miracle), but I'm torn on whether to take another gap year or if I should take this opportunity since there's no guarantee I'd be admitted again next year. \n\nIf I do another gap year, I would have a minimum of three publications (I've got 3-4 that should be published by June), I would spend the year working as an RA in a lab in my desired field, and obtain letters of rec from three different organizations now that I've built stronger relationships. I REALLY LIKE the program at Utah, but I don't LOVE it and I would hate not giving it another go at a few programs that I LOVE. However, the thought of turning down such an awesome and unexpected offer has me kicking myself.

You could also reflect on past experiences where you navigated uncertain situations and how you managed to adapt and grow from them. Remember, uncertainty doesn't mean failure; it's a natural part of growth and learning.\nclient: Thanks for that perspective, it really helps to think about focusing on what I can control instead of just worrying about the what-ifs. I’ve definitely handled uncertainty before, like when I wasn’t sure if I’d even get into any PhD program this round, and I just kept pushing forward with my apps and work. I guess I can lean on that mindset again, but it’s still kinda nerve-wracking to think about walking away from a solid offer. Do you think there’s a way to balance preparing for the gap year while maybe keeping some kind of connection with Utah, just in case?\nclient: Thanks for the suggestion about focusing on what I can control—it’s a good reminder to stay grounded. I’m just wondering if there’s a way to keep a foot in both doors, like staying in touch with Utah while I prep for a gap year, so I don’t feel like I’m completely closing that option off. What do you think about that idea?","completed":true}

I lost all my passion, didn't know what job I wanted, and was distracted by boys and friends and freedom. I didn't know I had undiagnosed depression and ADHD. I went back to school, but to a community college. Waste of time, all those classes meant nothing at a 4 year university. Refused to go back to my original school and went somewhere an hour away.

I'm all ears, ready to listen and support you in any way I can. What's on your mind today?\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here. I’m just really overwhelmed with regret about how my college years have gone and the choices I’ve made.\ntherapist: That sounds really tough. It can be hard to come to terms with the choices we've made and the path we've taken. I'm here to listen and help you work through these feelings, if you're comfortable sharing more about what's been going through your mind.\nclient: client: Thanks, I appreciate that. I just keep thinking about how I let so many things slip through my fingers, and now I’m scrambling to make up for lost time.\ntherapist: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when looking back and thinking about what could have been. Can you tell me more about what you feel slipped through your fingers?\nclient: Hey, yeah, I just feel like I missed out on so many chances to build a solid foundation for my future, you know? It’s like I was so caught up in everything else that I didn’t focus on what really mattered.\n\nI guess I’m just stuck on how I could’ve done things differently, and it’s eating at me. Like, I see other people my age who seem to have it all together, and I’m just… not there. Does that make sense? I don’t even know where to start fixing this mess.\ntherapist: I can hear how much this weighs on you, and it's completely understandable to feel that way. You're not alone in this struggle, and we can start by exploring what you hope to achieve, and then work on building a plan together.\nclient: Thanks, that means a lot to hear. I guess I just wanna get to a place where I feel like I’m moving forward, not stuck in this regret loop, ya know? Like, I wanna figure out how to make the most of what’s left of my time in school and beyond, but I’m kinda clueless on how to even start setting those goals or whatever. Where do we even begin with something like that?\ntherapist: I understand your desire to move forward and make the most of your time. We can start by exploring your strengths, values, and aspirations, and work from there to identify goals that align with who you are and what you want to achieve.\nclient: Cool, that sounds like a solid way to go. I’m just not super sure what my strengths even are right now, or like, what I really wanna do, so I hope we can figure that out together. Where do we start with digging into that stuff? I’m kinda all over the place, but I’m ready to try.\ntherapist: We can begin by reflecting on your past experiences and accomplishments, identifying moments when you felt most fulfilled or proud of yourself. This will help us uncover your strengths and values. It might also be helpful to think about the kind of person you aspire to be, and the things that bring you joy and fulfillment. Let's take this one step at a time, and work together to create a clearer picture of your aspirations and strengths.\nclient: Hey, that sounds like a good plan to me. I’m down to take it slow and figure out what’s been meaningful to me, even if it’s hard to see right now with all the mess in my head.\n\nSo, like, when you say reflecting on past experiences, do you mean stuff from school or just life in general? I’ve got some things I’m kinda proud of, but I’m not sure if they’re even relevant to where I wanna go. And honestly, I’m a little scared to dig too deep ‘cause I feel like I’ll just get stuck on the bad stuff again. How do we make sure I don’t spiral back into that regret thing while we’re doing this?\ntherapist: That's a great question. When I say reflecting on past experiences, I mean both school and life in general. Any experience that has left an impact on you, whether positive or challenging, can provide valuable insights into your strengths and values. It's natural to feel apprehensive about revisiting past regrets, but we can work together to ensure that we focus on what you've learned from those experiences rather than getting stuck on the negative emotions. We can also take breaks or shift the focus if you start to feel overwhelmed, so you're always in control of the process.\nclient: Thanks for explaining that. I like the idea of focusing on what I’ve learned instead of just the bad feelings, and knowing we can take breaks if it gets too heavy really helps.\n\nSo, I guess I’m ready to start thinking about some of those moments. Like, I remember feeling pretty good when I helped organize a small fundraiser for a club in high school, and I felt proud of pulling it together even though I was super shy back then. But I’m not sure how that connects to anything now, ya know? How do we take something like that and figure out if it’s a strength or just a random thing I did once?\ntherapist: That's a great example to start with! Let's unpack it together. What stood out to you about that experience? What skills or qualities do you think you used when you helped organize that fundraiser? Maybe we can find some clues there.\nclient: Hey, I’m glad we’re diving into this. I think what stood out was just seeing it all come together, like, I somehow got people to show up and we raised more than I expected, which felt kinda cool. I guess I had to talk to a bunch of people, even though I was shy, and figure out how to plan stuff step by step. I’m not sure if that’s a real skill or just something I stumbled through, though. How do we tell if that’s something I’m actually good at or if it was just a fluke?\ntherapist: That's a great observation. It sounds like you used some valuable skills like communication, planning, and maybe even some leadership abilities. Let's explore that a bit further. What do you think helped you push past your shyness and connect with people for the fundraiser?\nclient: Hey, I’m glad we’re digging into this. I think what helped me push past my shyness was just knowing it was for a good cause, like, I really cared about making it happen, so I kinda forced myself to talk to people even if it felt awkward at first.

I'm here to listen and support you, so feel free to share whatever's on your mind. Is there something specific you'd like to talk about, or shall we start with whatever feels most important to you right now?\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here. I’m really stressed about this upcoming ALEKS Math test at CSUS, and I just wanted to talk through my worries about potentially not doing well and what that might mean for my class placement.\ntherapist: That sounds really overwhelming—I can understand why you’d feel stressed about it. It’s okay to have those worries, and I’m here to help you unpack them. Can you tell me a bit more about what’s been on your mind lately regarding the test?\nclient: Client: Yeah, for sure. I’m just kinda freaking out because I’ve forgotten a lot of the older math stuff, even though I’ve taken all the high school math courses up to Calculus AB and BC, and I’m worried if I mess up this test, they’ll stick me in some super basic class despite my grades being good.\ntherapist: That’s a valid concern, especially with all the hard work you've put into your math education. It can be frustrating when you feel like your past efforts might not be recognized, and it's understandable that you're worried about being placed in a class that doesn't reflect your true abilities. What do you think would happen if you did end up in a lower-level class?\nclient: Client: Ugh, I just feel like it’d be such a waste of time, ya know? Like, I’ve already spent years getting through all those tough math classes with good grades, and having to redo stuff I’ve technically already learned would be so frustrating and might even mess up my schedule or delay my progress.\ntherapist: I can see why that would be frustrating and stressful. It sounds like you're worried about feeling like you're being held back and not able to move forward with your studies. Can you tell me more about what you've been doing to prepare for the test so far?\nclient: Client: Yeah, honestly, I’ve been trying to brush up on some old math concepts, like going through Khan Academy videos and some old textbooks, but it’s kinda overwhelming with all the stuff I’ve forgotten. I’m just worried it won’t be enough, and I don’t even know if I’m focusing on the right topics for the ALEKS test.\ntherapist: I can see how trying to cover all the forgotten material might feel like an uphill battle. It's great that you're taking proactive steps with Khan Academy and textbooks, but maybe focusing on the most critical topics for the ALEKS test could help streamline your studying and reduce the sense of overwhelm. Have you considered checking the test's official website or study guide for a detailed breakdown of the topics covered?\nclient: Client: Yeah, I did look at the ALEKS website a bit, but it’s kinda vague, and I’m not totally sure what’s most important to focus on. I guess I could dig deeper or maybe ask someone at CSUS for a better idea, but I’m just feeling so short on time and kinda panicking about it.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're doing your best to prepare, but the uncertainty around what topics to focus on is adding to your stress. I understand how overwhelming it can feel when you're short on time and unsure about where to direct your efforts. Perhaps we could explore ways to break down the material into more manageable chunks or prioritize the most essential topics together?\nclient: Client: Yeah, that sounds like it could help a lot. I’m just kinda lost on where to even start breaking it down, and I’m worried I’ll miss something big, ya know? Like, if you’ve got any ideas on how to organize this mess of math stuff or figure out what’s most important for the test, I’m all ears.\ntherapist: I hear how important this is for you, and it's okay to feel a bit lost. What if we start by looking at the test's official website or study guide again, and see if there are any specific sections or topics that are emphasized? Sometimes breaking it down into smaller, more focused areas can make it feel more manageable.\nclient: **Therapist:** I’m glad you’re open to working through this together, and I understand how daunting it can feel to tackle such a broad range of topics. Let’s take a structured approach by identifying key areas from the ALEKS framework and creating a priority list to focus your energy on—does that sound like a good starting point?\n\n**Client:** Yeah, that sounds way better than just randomly studying everything. Can we maybe make like a quick list or schedule or something right now? I just wanna feel like I’ve got a grip on this, ya know, instead of feeling like I’m drowning in math problems.\ntherapist: Absolutely, let's start building that list together! What if we look at the ALEKS framework and identify the top three to five most critical topics for the test? We can then prioritize those areas and create a study schedule that fits your time constraints. Does that sound like a good way to start?\nclient: **Client:** Yeah, that sounds perfect actually. Let’s do that—figuring out those top topics and making a schedule would really help me feel like I’ve got some control over this, ya know?\ntherapist: Let's start by identifying those key topics from the ALEKS framework. What areas do you feel are most challenging or require the most attention? We can prioritize those first to build your confidence and create a schedule around them.\nclient: **Client:** Honestly, I think algebra and trig are the ones that scare me the most right now.

I was previously academically dismissed and worked so hard to get back into my college and I did! The community college classes I took in the time between was so easy and I didn’t really learn to cultivate better habits as I was able to quickly do work and still get As, which felt good, but not the same at a 4 year college. I have been diagnosed with ADHD\/ anxiety\/ depression since the 5th grade and didn’t start utilizing accommodations until high school. Used them and did great. College is another story as I started to having to advocate for myself and thought all of my negative symptoms were how everyone felt and who I was. I never saw those things as barriers, but as I have gotten older, the dots have started clicking. I have been embarrassed to use my accommodations until this year because past friends made comments that it’s unfair and I took those to heart. The academic resource center purged my files upon my dismissal so it’s been a mess trying to get the correct documentation and my doctor only sent in the documentation last week even though I was asking for months. I am very frustrated as I’ve been falling behind due to my mental health rapidly declining this semester upon starting a new medication that made everything worse: insomnia, more anxiety, not taking care of myself, thoughts of unaliving myself, and started c*tting myself for a few weeks. I started to make the connection that it was my new med I started and then cut it cold Turkey and have felt better, but I’m still in a disassociative state making functioning hard.

What do you think might be the first small step you could take to prioritize your well-being, even if it's just a tiny change?\nclient: Client: I don’t know, maybe just saying no to stuff that feels risky, like skipping out on parties for now, even if it sucks to miss out. I guess I could try finding other ways to hang with friends, like grabbing food or watching a movie instead, but I’m still worried I’ll feel left out or like I’m not really part of things, you know?\ntherapist: It's completely understandable to feel torn between wanting to connect with others and needing to take care of yourself. It sounds like you're already thinking of some small steps you could take, like saying no to certain situations and finding alternative ways to spend time with friends. Would you be open to exploring some of those options further and seeing how they might help you feel more in control and less overwhelmed?\nclient: Client: Yeah, I think I’m open to trying that out, even if it feels kinda weird to change things up. I just hope I can still feel like I’m part of the group without always being in the middle of the risky stuff, you know?\ntherapist: That's a great point, and it's natural to want to maintain connections while also taking care of yourself. What if we brainstormed a few low-pressure social activities that might help you stay connected with your friends without feeling overwhelmed?\nclient: Client: For sure, I’d be down to brainstorm some ideas. Like, maybe just hitting up a coffee shop or doing something chill like a game night, but I’m still kinda nervous about how to bring it up without sounding lame or whatever, you know?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're already coming up with some great ideas, like coffee shops and game nights, that could help you stay connected with your friends while taking care of yourself. How about we think of a few ways you could suggest these activities without feeling awkward or worried about how your friends will react?\nclient: Client: Yeah, that’d be really helpful. I’m just worried they might think I’m being boring or overreacting, so figuring out how to say it without sounding like a buzzkill would be awesome, you know?\ntherapist: One approach could be to frame your suggestions as something you're personally excited to try, like, \"\"Hey, I found this awesome board game cafe downtown – we should check it out!\"\" or \"\"I've been craving some good coffee and conversation, wanna hit up that new spot?\"\" This way, you're not directly addressing your concerns, but still inviting them to join you in a different kind of activity. Another idea is to start with a question, like, \"\"What if we tried something a little different this weekend?\"\" – this opens up the conversation without immediately suggesting a specific activity.\nclient: Client: Yo, I like those ideas, especially the one about just saying I’m hyped to try something new. I think I could pull that off without it feeling too weird, but I’m still kinda stressing about if they push back or try to drag me into the usual stuff, you know?\ntherapist: It's totally normal to feel nervous about how your friends will react. How about we think of some responses you could use if they do push back or suggest the usual activities? For example, you could say something like, \"\"I'm really excited to try this new thing, but I'm also open to hearing your ideas! What if we do this today and save the other plans for another time?\"\"\nclient: Client: Yeah, that sounds like a solid way to handle it without shutting them down completely. I guess I’m just worried that if they keep pushing, I’ll cave or feel like I’m missing out, you know, FOMO is real, and I don’t wanna be the odd one out all the time.\nclient: Therapist: I get that FOMO can be tough, especially when you’re trying to balance your needs with staying connected. How about we brainstorm a couple of ways to remind yourself why you’re making these choices, and maybe even a quick phrase or mantra to keep your confidence up when you feel that pressure?\n\nClient: Yeah, I’d really appreciate that. It’d be cool to have something to lean on when I start second-guessing myself, especially in the moment when it’s hard to think straight.\nclient: Therapist: Great, let’s come up with a simple phrase or reminder that feels authentic to you, like, “I’m choosing what’s best for me right now,” or something that resonates with your goals. We can also think of a quick mental checklist to ground yourself if you feel that pressure creeping in.\n\nClient: That sounds super helpful. Maybe something short like “I’ve got this” could work—something I can just repeat to myself without overthinking it, you know?\nclient: Therapist: Absolutely, \"I’ve got this\" is a great choice—simple and empowering. Let’s also pair it with a quick mental note, like reminding yourself of one positive outcome you’re aiming for, to keep you focused when the doubt kicks in.\n\nClient: Cool, I think tying it to a specific reason, like feeling better about my choices, could really help me stay grounded. I’m feeling a bit more confident already just talking this out, so thanks for that.\nclient: Therapist: I'm glad you're feeling a bit more confident—that’s a great step forward. Is there anything else on your mind before we wrap up today?\n\nClient: Nah, I think I’m good for now. Just gonna keep practicing this stuff and see how it goes, ya know? Thanks for the help today.","completed":true}

It sounds like you've been feeling really stuck lately. Can you tell me a bit more about how this has been affecting you?\nclient: Yeah, it’s just this constant weight, you know, like I’m always comparing myself to others who seem so much further ahead. It makes me anxious and kinda embarrassed, especially being around younger students who are on a different timeline.\ntherapist: I can imagine how tough that must be, feeling like you're always looking over your shoulder and comparing yourself to others. It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of pressure and maybe even some shame.

What would that small breath of space give you, in those moments when you're already freaking out?\nclient: I think having even a tiny bit of space there would feel like a relief, like I’m not totally trapped by my thoughts. It’d probably give me a chance to remind myself that I’ve got this, even if it’s just for a second before the anxiety kicks back in.\ntherapist: You’re starting to visualize that space, even if it’s fleeting at first. What if we built on that momentary relief by adding a quick mental anchor, like silently repeating a short phrase that grounds you in that confidence, right after you take that breath?\nclient: That sounds like it could help, like having something to hold onto when my mind’s all over the place. What kinda phrase should I use, though, ‘cause I’m not sure what would feel right or stick with me when I’m in that anxious mess?\ntherapist: That's a great question, and it’s important that the phrase feels personal and meaningful to you. What if you thought about something simple and grounding, like a phrase that reminds you of your strength, like “I’ve got this,” or “I’m okay right now”? Or maybe a phrase that’s connected to a positive memory or emotion, like a favorite song lyric or a mantra that brings you peace? The key is to find something that resonates with you and feels like a gentle reminder of your inner strength, especially in those anxious moments.\nclient: I like the idea of keeping it simple, like “I’ve got this” could work since it’s short and I’ve kinda thought that before when I push through tough stuff. Do you think it’s okay if I change it up sometimes if something else feels better in the moment, or should I stick to one thing?\ntherapist: It's completely okay to adapt your phrase as needed—what matters most is that it feels empowering in the moment. If \"I've got this\" becomes your go-to but you occasionally find another phrase resonates more, that's part of the process. You're not locked into one option, just like your confidence can grow in different ways. How does that flexibility sound to you?\nclient: That flexibility sounds really good, honestly, like I’m not boxed into one way of handling things. I guess I’m just worried I might overthink it in the moment and forget what to say to myself—does that happen a lot, or am I stressing too much about this?\ntherapist: That's a common concern, and it's not too much to worry about—many people find that the phrase becomes more automatic with practice, especially when paired with that intentional breath. You might even jot down a few options to keep somewhere handy, like a note in your phone, to refer to if your mind goes blank in the moment.\nclient: That’s a good idea, having a few phrases in my phone as a backup feels like a safety net. I’m just wondering, do you think practicing this outside of stressful moments, like when I’m calm, could help it stick better when I really need it?\nclient: Yeah: I think that’s a smart approach, and practicing when you’re calm can definitely help it feel more natural during tougher times. If it’s okay, I’d like to try that out and see how it feels over the next week or so.\n\nJust curious, do you think there’s anything else I should be focusing on alongside this to help with the anxiety, or should I just start with this for now?\nclient: I’m glad you’re open to trying this out over the next week. I guess I’m just wondering if there’s anything else I should be pairing with this to keep the anxiety in check, or if I should just focus on getting comfortable with this first?\nclient: I’m glad to hear you’re on board with trying this out. I guess I’m just curious if there’s anything else I should be working on alongside this to help manage the anxiety, or if sticking with this for now is the best starting point?","completed":true}

I'm here to listen and support you in any way I can. Please feel free to share whatever is on your mind or whatever you'd like to talk about. I'm all ears and ready to help.\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here. I’ve been kinda stuck on this decision about whether to live alone or with roommates next year, and I’m just not sure what’s the best move for me.\ntherapist: It's totally normal to feel stuck on a decision like that, and it sounds like you're really weighing the pros and cons. Can you tell me a little bit more about what's been making this decision feel so tricky?\nclient: Yeah, I guess it’s just hard to know if I’ll feel isolated if I live alone, or if I’ll miss out on the social stuff with roommates. I’m torn between wanting my own space and not wanting to feel lonely, ya know?\n\nSo, like, have you worked with other students who’ve had to make this kind of choice? What did they end up doing, or what helped them figure it out?\ntherapist: Yeah, I’ve definitely worked with students who’ve struggled with this decision before. Some of them found that the best way to figure it out was by thinking about what they needed most in that moment—whether it was the comfort of their own space or the camaraderie of roommates. It’s all about understanding what will make you feel most balanced and happy in the long run.\nclient: Cool, that makes sense. I guess I’m just trying to figure out if I’ll be okay on my own, or if I’ll end up feeling like I’m missing out on stuff, ya know, like those random late-night talks with roommates or whatever. What do you think I should focus on to really get clear on what I need right now?\ntherapist: One thing that could help is thinking about your current routine and how you'd adapt to either situation. For example, if you enjoy your own space, how would you maintain social connections while living alone? If you value those spontaneous roommate moments, how would you ensure you have enough personal time if you live with others? It's about finding a balance that works for you.\nclient: Thanks for the suggestion. I think I do enjoy my own space a lot, but I’m worried I might feel too cut off without people around, ya know, like I’d have to go out of my way to see friends. How do you think I can kinda test out how I’d feel in either situation before I make a final call?\ntherapist: It might help to try out a little experiment, like spending a weekend or a few days in a solo environment to see how it feels, or maybe staying with a friend or family member to gauge what that experience is like. You could also talk to people who have lived alone and with roommates to get a sense of their experiences and what they learned from them.\nclient: Got it, that sounds like a solid idea.

I have a deadline to pass that class this next semester and if I don’t I’ll be kicked from the business program and won’t have access to any of the above listed majors. Already the prospects of having a nice info sys job are starting to dim. The only major I can think of that will allow me to not take calculus and graduate in a reasonable time is interdisciplinary studies. My remaining classes until I graduate would be poli sci because why not, I think it’s an interesting subject and there’d be no point to taking my remaining business or finance or information systems classes if I can’t have that major at the end of it.  \n\n\n..  \n\n\nTl;dr I suck at calculus  \n\n\nSo basically what my two questions are: will I be stuck working minimum wage jobs with the degree in the title or is there some hope for a “normal” working-in-an-office job?  \nWhat are some jobs that are open to both business and political science majors (because I’m assuming that’s where I’d most likely be heading with this plan)?","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome to our session today!

It’s like I’m torn between a bunch of interests but can’t nail down what I should actually pursue.\n\nSo, yeah, I guess I’m just kinda lost on how to even start figuring this out.

Have you considered exploring how your interests in humanities, art, or writing might complement or even enhance your work in healthcare?\nclient: Yeah, I’ve thought about it a little, but I’m not sure how those things can really fit together with healthcare in a practical way.

I just don’t want to end up in a job that feels like a grind, you know?\ntherapist: I think it’s really powerful that you’re considering how your creative and humanities interests can complement your passion for healthcare—it shows a desire for a career that truly aligns with your unique strengths. One idea could be exploring roles in healthcare communication or advocacy, where you might use your writing or storytelling skills to help patients or communities in a more flexible way. Have you ever thought about roles like that, or do they feel too far from the hands-on work you value?\nclient: Yeah, healthcare communication or advocacy sounds kinda interesting, like it could be a cool way to mix my skills.

What do you think would help you feel more confident about your choice?\nclient: Honestly, I think having some kind of reassurance that I can catch up and not be totally lost would help a ton. Maybe like, knowing there are resources or ways to get a head start before I’m drowning in coursework—do you think there’s stuff I can do now to prep myself?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're eager to set yourself up for success, which is a really positive sign! There are definitely ways to prepare before diving into coursework—have you considered looking into online tutorials, introductory courses, or even connecting with upperclassmen or professors in the department? These could help you build a foundation and get a sense of what to expect. What do you think about exploring some of these options?\nclient: Yeah, I think that sounds like a good idea—looking into online tutorials or reaching out to people in the department could really help me get a feel for things. I just gotta figure out where to start with that, you know, like which resources are actually worth my time.\ntherapist: It's great that you're open to exploring these options and taking proactive steps to prepare yourself for your computer science major. Let's start by identifying some specific resources that could be a good fit for you. What areas within computer science are you most interested in, or do you have any specific goals in mind? This could help us narrow down which tutorials or courses might be most beneficial for you.\nclient: Honestly, I’m not super sure yet about specific areas since I’m so new to it, but I think stuff like coding basics or maybe something related to building apps sounds cool. I guess my main goal right now is just to get a grip on the fundamentals so I’m not totally lost when classes start—can we figure out some beginner-friendly stuff to focus on?\ntherapist: I'm glad to hear you're excited about exploring computer science and eager to start with the basics. Building a strong foundation in coding and app development sounds like a solid first step, and there are plenty of beginner-friendly resources available. How about we start with some popular platforms like Codecademy, Coursera, or edX? They offer introductory courses on coding basics and app development that could give you a solid head start. Would you be interested in checking those out?\nclient: Yeah, that sounds like a great starting point—I'm definitely down to check out Codecademy or Coursera to get a handle on the basics. I just hope I can keep up with it and not feel overwhelmed right off the bat, you know?\ntherapist: It's great that you're excited about exploring computer science and eager to start with the basics! Building a strong foundation in coding and app development is a solid first step, and there are plenty of beginner-friendly resources available. I'm glad you're open to checking out platforms like Codecademy or Coursera, which offer introductory courses on coding basics and app development. To help you stay on track and avoid feeling overwhelmed, let's break down your learning process into smaller, manageable tasks. How about setting aside a specific time each day or week to focus on your tutorials? You could also consider connecting with other beginners or online communities for support and motivation.\nclient: Hey, that sounds like a solid plan—setting aside specific times to work on tutorials could really help me stay consistent without getting stressed out. And yeah, connecting with other beginners online would be cool too, just to have people to bounce ideas off of or ask dumb questions without feeling judged.\ntherapist: It's great that you're open to setting aside dedicated time for tutorials and connecting with other beginners! This approach can help you stay focused and motivated. Let's consider creating a simple schedule to allocate time for tutorials each week. How many hours per week do you think you could realistically commit to practicing coding and app development? We can work together to create a plan that fits your schedule and helps you stay on track.\nclient: Hey, I’m glad we’re figuring this out together—I think I could realistically commit to maybe 5 or 6 hours a week to start with, since I’ve got other stuff going on too. Can we maybe set up a little schedule or something to split that time across a few days so it doesn’t feel like too much at once?\nclient: I'm really appreciative of your help in mapping this out. How about we break those 5 or 6 hours into a couple of shorter sessions across the week to keep it manageable?\nclient: Thanks for helping me think through this. I’m feeling good about starting with those 5 or 6 hours and splitting them up—maybe we can figure out which days work best for me to stay consistent?","completed":true}

Now I've resumed the second year and its past christmas and I am horribly un-motivated. i stopped going in, and have only been job searching the past few weeks.\n\nim due for a supervisory meeting with a wonderful lecturer but i think i should confess i need to quit.

It can be really overwhelming to navigate career uncertainty, especially in a field as important as education. Can you tell me more about what's been causing you the most confusion lately?\nclient: client: Yeah, for sure. It’s just like I keep bouncing between different ideas about what level to teach or if I even want to teach at all, and I’m worried I might pick something that doesn’t fit me in the long run.\ntherapist: That must feel really frustrating and exhausting, like you're constantly second-guessing yourself. It sounds like you're worried about making a choice that might not align with your true interests or strengths in the long run. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been driving your doubts about teaching altogether?\nclient: client: Yeah, it’s kinda draining to keep questioning everything. I guess I’m just worried that teaching might not be as fulfilling as I hoped, or that I’ll end up stuck in a role that stresses me out more than it makes me happy. What do you think I should focus on to figure out if this is really the right path for me?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're craving a deeper sense of fulfillment and balance in your career, and it's completely normal to want to ensure that your path aligns with your true self. One approach could be to reflect on what aspects of teaching excite or inspire you, while also considering what might be contributing to those feelings of stress or uncertainty. Would you like to explore that together?\nclient: client: Yeah, I’d really like that. I think figuring out what parts of teaching actually get me excited versus what’s just stressing me out could help me see things clearer.\ntherapist: I'm glad we're diving into this together, and I'm curious to hear more about what parts of teaching genuinely excite or inspire you, as well as what aspects have been causing stress or uncertainty. What comes to mind when you think about the moments that make you feel most engaged or fulfilled in your teaching journey so far?\nclient: client: Honestly, when I think about the moments that get me excited, it’s like imagining connecting with kids and seeing them light up when they get something I’ve explained. But then, I also worry about the stuff I’ve heard, like the overwhelming workload or not having enough time, and that kinda pulls me back down.\ntherapist: It’s clear that the moments when you connect with students and witness their growth bring you joy, but the weight of external concerns holds you back. Perhaps we could explore how those fulfilling moments align with your long-term goals and values, while also addressing the doubts that create uncertainty?\nclient: client: Yeah, that sounds really helpful. I wanna dig into how those good moments can outweigh the tough stuff, and figure out if my goals match up with what teaching actually involves.\ntherapist: I'm here to listen and help you navigate these feelings without judgment. Let's focus on understanding your motivations and values, and how they might intersect with your teaching aspirations. Would you like to explore how your ideal teaching experience aligns with your long-term goals, and what steps might bring you closer to achieving that balance?\nclient: client: Totally, I’d love to figure out how my ideal vision of teaching fits with where I wanna go in life. Like, I wanna make sure I’m chasing something that feels right for me long-term, ya know?\ntherapist: Let's dive into that ideal vision of teaching together. What does that perfect teaching experience look like for you—specifically in terms of the impact you want to have, your work environment, and the kind of fulfillment you’re seeking?\nclient: client: Honestly, my perfect teaching experience would be in a place where I’m really making a difference, like seeing kids grow and feel confident because of something I’ve taught them. I picture a supportive environment, maybe smaller classes or a school that values creativity, and just feeling like my work matters every day, ya know?\ntherapist: Your ideal vision of teaching paints a beautiful picture of impact, connection, and meaning—how can we start building steps to make that vision a reality, while also addressing the external concerns that have been weighing on you?\nclient: client: Yeah, I’m all for figuring out some real steps to get closer to that vision, ‘cause I want it to feel doable. Maybe we can talk about ways to test the waters or handle those worries about the challenges I’ve been hearing about, ya know?\ntherapist: That sounds like a great way to move forward.

What do you think would help it carry that personal significance?\n\nClient: I think picking something that already feels special might work best, like maybe a small pebble I’ve had for a while from a trip or something.

That shows a lot of self-awareness and willingness to learn from this experience. As for what you can do now, talking to someone about it might help you process your feelings and gain a different perspective. Is there someone in particular you were thinking of reaching out to?\nclient: Yeah, I was thinking about maybe emailing my professor or the TA to explain what happened, just to see if there’s any chance for partial credit or at least to get some feedback. I’m kinda nervous about it though, ‘cause I don’t want it to seem like I’m just begging for points or something.\ntherapist: It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling nervous about reaching out to your professor or TA. You’re not alone in feeling that way, and it takes courage to put yourself out there. Remember, your request for feedback is not a plea for mercy—it’s an opportunity for growth and understanding. It’s okay to express your concerns and ask for support; that’s a sign of strength, not weakness.\nclient: Thanks for saying that, it helps to hear that reaching out isn’t just about asking for something but also about growing. I just don’t wanna come off the wrong way, you know, and I’m still kinda torn on how to even word an email like that without sounding desperate.\ntherapist: That's a valid concern, and it's great that you're considering how to approach this thoughtfully. One way to frame it could be to focus on your learning process and the value you place on feedback, rather than just asking for points. Maybe you could say something like, \"\"I'm reaching out because I'm committed to improving my work, and I'd really appreciate any feedback you can offer to help me grow as a student.\"\" This way, you're emphasizing your growth mindset and showing that you're invested in learning from the experience, rather than just trying to fix the immediate problem.\nclient: Thanks, I really like that idea of focusing on growth and feedback instead of just the grade. I’ll probably draft something like that and see how it feels, just to make sure I’m getting the tone right. I’m still a bit worried about how they might take it, but I guess I won’t know unless I try, right? I just wanna make sure I’m being respectful and not overstepping any boundaries.\ntherapist: You've already taken such a thoughtful approach to this, and I'm sure your professor or TA will appreciate the care and consideration you're putting into your message. It might also help to remember that you're not asking for special treatment, but rather seeking guidance to improve your work, which is a perfectly valid and respectful request.\nclient: Thanks, that reassurance really helps me feel a bit more confident about reaching out. I’ll keep focusing on the idea of just asking for guidance and not making it seem like I’m pushing for anything more than that.\nclient: Thanks for the encouragement, it’s nice to have that perspective to lean on. So, I guess I’ll get started on that email soon—maybe even tonight if I can get my thoughts together.","completed":true}
{"id":"15fzu6r","timestamp":1690934400000,"category":"academic","concern":"So I'm (21F) a first year in MBA (post grad) and my bachelors was in science. Its been a month since my course started and I had been enjoying it, despite the immense work load and studying.\n\nJust academic pressure was ok with me, I'm used to it. However recently they started interviews for student committees and clubs which took a toll on me because my midterm exams are in 2 days and these clubs are all making us do complicated and time consuming tasks right before the exam. \n\nI'm a bit of a perfectionist, so when the club I really wanted to join initially, asked us to submit like 10 documents including videos, budgeting plan, etc etc all within 10 hours, I got really stressed out, thinking that my whole day and night will go into this and I'll not be able to study for my exams.\n\nI wanted to do the best in both. But I realised that if I attempt to do the best in the club activity, my exams will suffer, and vice versa. I'm required to study more than other students because I come from a Science background so it's difficult to understand commerce related subjects. I ended up getting a terrible headache, chills, fever, and by the night I was not in a state to finish anything and was crying like a fool.\n\nI dropped out of the selection process for all clubs because in the end I felt like academics are more important for me and not something I can sacrifice for clubs that only host events n stuff. \n\nNow its morning, the next day, and I feel better and relaxed because now my only focus is studying. \n\nMy peers told me that joining clubs is not necessary, and that I can do other extra-curriculars and spend my time in getting the most knowledge I can, learning new skills, and participating in competitons.\n\nWas there anything wrong with what I did? I felt like I lacked management skills and ended up getting stressed, which made me think that different people have different capacity, but that felt like a limiting mindset, that I'm incapable of managing both activities at once.\n\nActually it was my inability to give my 100% in both areas that made me anxious to this extent.\n\nWhat do you guys suggest?

I'm so glad you're here. Please feel free to share whatever's been on your mind lately. We'll take it at your pace, and I'm here to listen without judgment.\nclient: Thanks for being here, I really appreciate having someone to talk to. I’ve been struggling a lot with my schoolwork, especially last semester, and I’m just feeling stuck on how to move forward with these overwhelming feelings.\ntherapist: That sounds incredibly challenging, and it's understandable that you'd feel stuck in the face of such overwhelming emotions. It takes courage to share this, and I'm here to support you without judgment. Can you tell me more about what's been making your schoolwork feel so unmanageable lately?\nclient: I’m just finding it really hard to even start my assignments because I get so overwhelmed by the thought of them. It’s like this heavy weight that stops me before I can even try, and I end up avoiding everything.\ntherapist: That sounds like an incredibly frustrating and disheartening cycle to be stuck in, especially when you're trying your best to make progress. It takes a lot of courage to share this, and I'm here to listen and support you without judgment. What does it feel like when you think about starting those assignments, and what are some of the things that have helped you in the past when you've faced similar challenges?\nclient: It feels like this intense dread and tightness in my chest, like I’m already failing before I even open the textbook. I don’t really remember anything specific that’s helped before; I just kinda end up distracting myself until the last minute, which obviously doesn’t work.\n\nI guess I’m just wondering if there’s some way to break this cycle, you know? Like, is there a trick to making myself start without feeling like I’m gonna spiral? I’m so tired of feeling paralyzed by this, and I really can’t afford to mess up again this semester.\ntherapist: It sounds like this cycle of dread and avoidance has been weighing heavily on you, and it's completely understandable that you'd feel desperate for a way to break free from it. I can only imagine how exhausting and frustrating it must be to feel like you're already failing before you've even begun.\nclient: Yeah, it’s just draining, you know? I want to get out of this hole, but every time I think about starting, it’s like my brain and body just shut down. Is there maybe a small step or something I can try to make it less overwhelming, even if it’s just a tiny thing to get me going?\ntherapist: It's completely understandable that you'd feel desperate for a way to break free from this cycle, and it's encouraging to hear you're open to trying even a small step. It sounds like you're craving a sense of control and momentum, and perhaps a tiny, manageable action could be the first step towards reclaiming that control. What if we explored together what that first small step might look like for you?\nclient: Yeah, I’m definitely up for figuring out something small to start with, anything that doesn’t feel like a huge mountain to climb. What kind of tiny step do you think could work for me, like something that won’t trigger that instant dread?\ntherapist: You mentioned the intense dread and tightness in your chest when thinking about starting assignments. Let's explore some small steps that might help ease that physical and emotional reaction. For instance, perhaps opening your textbook and simply reading the first page of the chapter, or setting a timer for just five minutes to jot down any thoughts or ideas you have about the assignment. These small actions might help you build momentum without feeling overwhelmed. How do these ideas resonate with you?\nclient: Honestly, the idea of just reading the first page or setting a timer for five minutes sounds doable, like it’s not this huge commitment that’s gonna crush me right away. I’m kinda worried I’ll still feel that dread creeping in, but I think I could at least try that and see how it goes—do you think starting that small can really make a difference over time?\ntherapist: That's a great question, and it's natural to feel skeptical about whether such small steps can really lead to lasting change. But often, it's those tiny, seemingly insignificant actions that can gradually build momentum and break the cycle of dread and avoidance. It's like the ripple effect of a stone thrown into water—each small action creates a ripple that can grow into a wave over time.\nclient: Yeah, I get what you’re saying about the ripple effect, and I like the idea of small actions adding up.

Especially the neopronouns\/neogenders crowd. I was made fun of for being trans by other kids and called an \"it\" or asked if I identified as a cat\/dog and how that meant it was okay to sh\/\/t me. And it really dehumanized me--it's a part of my life I don't particularly want shoved in my face every day even if I'm okay speaking up for myself or talking about only occasionally.\n\nI try to be an accepting person. And I do not hate the neopronouns\/neogenders crowd, but being around them makes me uncomfortable so I tend to steer clear. Although I firmly believe you should I what makes you happy I do not think these things are rooted in a medically necessary basis the same way gender dysphoria is. And I worry they would hate me for that belief even if I were to accept\/respect them as people regardless of what I think.\n\nIf I put it out there that I didn't really wanna room with people like that would everyone get mad at me for being exclusionary? My school isn't that large and I don't want to have a tough time with the few people I get the opportunity to make friends with.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello there!

Have you ever thought about what kind of support or strategies might help you feel more confident in those moments?\nclient: I mean, I’m not really sure what would help since I’ve never had any real support for this before. I guess maybe talking through stuff or learning some ways to calm down when I’m freaking out could be a start, but I don’t even know where to begin with that.\ntherapist: It’s great that you’re open to exploring different strategies and forms of support. Talking through your concerns and learning relaxation techniques could be a good starting point. Have you considered reaching out to your college’s counseling services or a support group for social anxiety?\nclient: Yeah, I’ve thought about checking out counseling services at college, but I’m kinda nervous about even starting that process. I just don’t know how to bring this up or if they’ll even take me seriously without some kind of official diagnosis or something.\ntherapist: It's understandable that you feel apprehensive about reaching out for help, especially when it involves sharing your personal struggles with someone new. However, counseling services at your college are there to support students in a non-judgmental and confidential environment, and they can help you work through your anxiety and develop coping strategies. You don't need an official diagnosis to seek their assistance. They can also guide you on how to bring up your concerns and make the process as smooth and comfortable as possible for you.\nclient: Thanks for explaining that, it does make me feel a bit less stressed knowing I don’t need a diagnosis to get started. I’m just still kinda worried about how to even walk in there and say what’s going on without feeling super awkward or like I’m overreacting.\ntherapist: It’s okay to feel nervous about taking that first step, but you deserve support and there’s no right or wrong way to start the conversation. You could begin by sharing how your anxiety has impacted your college experience and your desire to improve it, which would likely resonate with the counselor. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\nclient: Thanks, I appreciate that. I guess I just need to push myself to get in there and start talking, even if it feels weird at first. I’m still kinda scared I’ll freeze up or not know what to say, though—do you have any tips for like, getting through that first meeting without totally panicking?\ntherapist: One approach could be to practice a brief, honest opening statement ahead of time, like \"\"I'm here because I've been struggling with social anxiety and I'd like to explore ways to manage it better.\"\" This can help ease the initial pressure. Another tip is to remind yourself that it's normal to feel uneasy in these situations, and that the counselor is there to support you, not judge you.\nclient: Hey, thanks for the suggestion about practicing what to say—that actually sounds doable. I’m just worried I’ll still get all shaky and mess it up, but I guess I’ll try writing something down and going over it a few times before I go in.\ntherapist: That sounds like a solid plan, and you're taking an important step by preparing yourself ahead of time. Remember that it's okay if you don't stick to your script perfectly - the counselor will understand that you're feeling nervous, and they're there to guide you through the process.\nclient: Thanks, that’s reassuring to hear. I’ll definitely try to keep that in mind and not stress too much if I stumble over my words. I’m just wondering, like, how long do you think it usually takes to feel a bit more comfortable talking in those sessions? I know it’s probably different for everyone, but I’m kinda curious about what to expect.\nclient: Thanks for asking, I’m really curious about how this might play out over time. I just hope I can get to a point where opening up doesn’t feel so tough, you know?\nclient: Thanks for checking in on that. I’m just hoping I don’t stay stuck feeling this nervous for too long, and I’d love to hear any thoughts you have on what might help speed up getting more at ease with it.\nclient: Thanks for the reassurance and for understanding where I’m coming from. I’m just wondering if there are any small steps or strategies you’d suggest to help me feel a bit more settled during those early sessions?\nclient: Thanks for the ideas, I really appreciate the guidance on easing into those sessions. I’m just hoping I can start feeling a bit more at ease soon, and I’ll definitely give those strategies a shot. So, before we wrap up, do you have any quick tips for managing that initial nerves right when I walk in?\nclient: Thanks for the suggestions, I’ll definitely try to keep them in mind. I’m just hoping I can shake off those first few minutes of nerves, so any last quick advice on that would be great before we end.","completed":true}

The speaker is outwardly and actively pro-conversion therapy and the vice chancellor states that they can’t do anything because of “freedom of speech” which obviously is something that can’t be infringed upon but this feels like bordering hate speech. I’m non-binary and very gay, and I feel very, very lost. \n\nI’m not sure what else can be done. Some news outlets I think are picking it up and protests are planned, but I feel kind of helpless. Any more tips for trying to fight this?\n\nEdit to answer some questions: the event is allegedly discussing LGBT issues that our generation is facing. I've looked at some of the speaker's speeches, and her website, and she very clearly talks about sex and gender being the same thing, how that wasn't God's original plan, how we're destroying his \"sweet language,\" that trans people aren't real, how it's all deception... etc. There is an LGBTQIA+ organization on campus, and they're leading the protest with the assistance of some local churches. \n\nI also realize that I may have used 'hate speech' incorrectly, and I do understand that despite how weird it is, it is protected under the First Amendment.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome to our session today!

{"id":"111d3h7","timestamp":1676246400000,"category":"emotional","concern":"I've been struggling most of my life with pretty bad depression, and things only started to get better after my first year in college. But now I've fallen back into it, very deeply. I don't know how much to share but for an idea of how bad it's gotten, I have been skipping a lot of my classes and not doing any of my assignments, nor caring enough to do anything about it. I have suicidal thoughts, and I'm trying to get onto antidepressants but it's difficult to get diagnosis and seek medical help due to conflict with my parents and school. I've also been trying to get diagnosed with ADHD, which I've been pretty sure I have for a long time now, but that has been difficult too. I have a therapist I see twice a week, which has been helpful sometimes, but I think I need more.\n\nI don't think I can keep going like this. my last semester I got all A's, so to outsiders it seems like I'm doing fine, but man, I'm an art student. Grades barely matter, and those A's are more indicative of how generous and understanding my professors were; in reality I barely attended class, finished less than half of my projects the whole semester, and dropped classes to go part-time, hoping it would help, but it wasn't enough. \n\nMy parents and my therapist have basically told me different versions of \"just power through it\", but I can't. Especially because all of my assignments are art. It's not a set start or finish, a list of questions to answer, or busywork. It's always personal and being creative is really hard for me right now, almost impossible. My parents are also scared that if I take a leave of absence and get a job or something, I'll be stuck doing that forever and never go back to school. The only person that has suggested that a leave might be a good idea was my advisor. \n\nBut I know a lot of people deal with depression in college, and they still carry on. Am I just being lazy, or giving up too easily? Just making an excuse to do nothing? I want to spend the time off seeking more active mental help, but is that enough reason? I don't know anymore.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Hello there! I'm really glad you've decided to reach out and talk about whatever is on your mind.

I'm really glad you've decided to reach out and talk about whatever is on your mind. It's totally okay to take your time, and I'm here to listen whenever you're ready.\nclient: Hey, thanks for being here. I’m just feeling really overwhelmed with everything right now and not sure where to even start.\ntherapist: That's completely understandable, and I'm here for you. Sometimes when we feel overwhelmed, it can be helpful to start by sharing whatever feels most important or pressing to you right now.\nclient: Hey, I guess the most pressing thing is just how stuck I feel with my depression and school. Like, I’m skipping classes, not doing assignments, and I can’t even bring myself to care, but I’m not sure if I’m just making excuses or if I really need a break.\n\nMan, it’s so hard to even talk about this without feeling like I’m just whining. I’ve got all these thoughts swirling—suicidal ones too—and I’m trying to get help with meds and maybe an ADHD diagnosis, but it’s such a slow process. I’m seeing you twice a week which helps a bit, but I feel like I’m drowning, you know? My art assignments are the worst part; I can’t create anything when I’m like this. I’m just wondering if I should take a leave of absence or if that’s me giving up. What do you think about that idea?\ntherapist: That's a lot to carry on your shoulders, and it's understandable that you're feeling stuck and unsure about what to do. It sounds like you're juggling a lot of different things, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're not whining, you're just expressing what you're going through, and that's important. It's good that you're seeking help, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.\nclient: Thanks for saying that, it helps to hear I’m not just complaining. I just feel so torn about taking a leave—part of me thinks it might give me space to focus on getting better, but I’m scared I’ll never come back to school if I step away. What do you think about taking a break? Like, could it actually help, or am I just running from my problems?\ntherapist: I can see how torn you feel about this decision, and it’s understandable that you're worried about the potential consequences. It's possible that taking a break could give you the space you need to focus on your mental health, but it's also valid to be concerned about the possibility of not returning to school. Perhaps we could explore what it would look like to take a leave of absence, and what steps you could take to ensure that you do return to school when you're ready?\nclient: Thanks for being open to exploring this with me. I guess I’m just nervous about how to even structure a break—would I just be sitting around feeling worse, or could I actually use the time to get better with more intensive help or something? Like, I want to make sure it’s not just me avoiding stuff, you know? What kind of steps could we think about to make sure I’d come back to school after a leave?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're really trying to be thoughtful about this decision, which is great. Taking a break doesn't have to mean just sitting around—could you imagine using the time to focus on your mental health, maybe even with more intensive support? And as for coming back to school, maybe we could brainstorm some ideas, like setting a date to revisit the decision or creating a plan to gradually return to classes?\nclient: Thanks for helping me think this through. I like the idea of setting a date to check in on coming back—it makes it feel less like I’m just walking away forever. I’m still kinda worried about what “more intensive support” would even look like, though. Like, I’m already seeing you twice a week, but I don’t know if there’s something more out there that could help me get out of this hole faster. Do you have any thoughts on what kind of extra help I could look into during a break?\ntherapist: It's great that you're considering ways to use a break productively, and I appreciate your openness to exploring options. More intensive support could mean anything from daily therapy sessions, to inpatient treatment programs, or even online resources and support groups. The key is to find something that works for you and your needs. What do you think might be most helpful for you during this time?\nclient: I'm glad you're helping me think through what could work, 'cause I’m honestly not sure what I need beyond what we’re already doing. I guess something more structured or frequent sounds interesting, but I’m kinda overwhelmed just thinking about inpatient stuff or finding the right groups—do you think we could narrow it down together based on what’s realistic for me right now?\ntherapist: Absolutely, let’s work together to figure out what’s realistic and manageable for you. Perhaps we could start by considering what your current schedule and energy levels would allow, and then explore options that align with those constraints? For instance, if daily therapy sessions seem too intense, we could look into partial hospitalization programs that offer structure without requiring a full-time commitment. Or if inpatient treatment feels overwhelming, maybe online resources and support groups could provide the additional support you're looking for without being too demanding. We can take it step by step, and I’m here to help you navigate the options.\nclient: Thanks for being willing to break this down with me—I really appreciate the guidance.

{"id":"1fwghnn","timestamp":1728086400000,"category":"interpersonal","concern":"As the title says my roommate doesn’t clean up after themself. Now our room isn’t a complete disaster and it’s mainly their side (plus our bathroom but it’s kinda 70\/30 on who makes the most mess of it) but they just don’t really clean up. They have cups and cans and bottles all over their nightstand and desk and have even had a cup under their bed on the dresser before, and they’re never empty either. They also go home every weekend so they don’t really have dishes or real food here so they’re all Starbucks and Dunkin’ cups, so half full coffees just sitting there separating for weeks as they go home and come back. They do sorta clean it after a few weeks, I’ve seen them bag up the cups and other garbage, but they don’t take it out. They have bags full of garbage in the corner on their side of the room and our rooms not big so it’s starting to creep towards our closet almost in the way of it. As for the bathroom they leave hair everywhere and I know it’s theirs and not mine because it’s their little rubber bands with the hair. Now like I said I am also at fault for the the bathroom being messy but I try to keep it somewhat clean by taking out the garbage and have cleaned the shower drain but they don’t even try to clean up a bit. I don’t know how they don’t get embarrassed when they have a friend over or even just with me being here. I get embarrassed having 2 cans on my desk and a few dirty forks or spoons for a few days because I’m too tired to wash them yet. Otherwise they’re a good roommate it’s just they never clean. I should also say they had a single room last year so it definitely feels like part of the reason since they would be used to not sharing a space but I want to have friends over and I’m embarrassed for my roommate.

I'm here to listen without judgment and help you explore any thoughts or concerns that have been on your mind. Take your time, and feel free to share whatever comes to you naturally.\nclient: Thanks for being here. I’ve been feeling pretty frustrated lately about some stuff with my roommate, and I just don’t know how to handle it without making things weird.\ntherapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck between wanting to address the issue and not wanting to create tension with your roommate. Can you tell me more about what's been causing this frustration?\nclient: Yeah, it’s just really getting to me how messy things are, and I feel like I’m stuck dealing with it. I don’t want to come off as rude or start a fight, but it’s hard to ignore when it’s right there in our shared space.\ntherapist: That sounds like a really tough spot to be in, feeling like you have to choose between your own comfort and the potential for conflict with your roommate. It's totally understandable that you're feeling frustrated and stuck. Can you tell me more about what kind of messes you're dealing with, and how they've been affecting you?\nclient: Honestly, it’s just the constant clutter and lack of effort on their part that’s getting to me. It makes me feel uneasy in my own space, like I can’t fully relax or have people over without being embarrassed.\ntherapist: It sounds like the clutter and lack of effort from your roommate is really affecting your sense of comfort and pride in your space. What do you think would make the biggest difference for you, in terms of how you'd like things to be different?\nclient: Honestly, I think if they just picked up after themselves a bit and took out their trash regularly, it’d make a huge difference. I’d feel so much better not having to see the mess piling up or worry about it when I want to have friends over.\ntherapist: It sounds like having your roommate take responsibility for their belongings and cleaning up after themselves would go a long way in alleviating your stress and making you feel more comfortable in your shared space. Do you think there's a way to bring this up with your roommate in a way that feels respectful and open to finding a solution together?\nclient: Yeah, I think I could try to talk to them about it, maybe just casually mention how the mess is kinda stressing me out and suggest we both keep things tidier. I’m just nervous about how they’ll take it, you know, since I don’t want to seem like I’m nagging or starting drama.\ntherapist: That’s a thoughtful approach, and it sounds like you’re already considering how to bring this up in a way that’s respectful and collaborative. What do you think might happen if you were to have that conversation with your roommate, and what could help you feel more confident in bringing it up?\nclient: I guess I’m worried they might get defensive or think I’m being too picky, and I don’t want things to get awkward between us since we’ve been getting along otherwise. Having some kinda backup plan, like knowing I can just focus on my side if they don’t take it well, might help me feel a bit braver about starting the convo.\ntherapist: That's a really good point, and it makes sense that you want to maintain your positive relationship with your roommate. Having a backup plan can be a great way to feel more confident when approaching a difficult conversation. What do you think your backup plan could look like?\nclient: I think my backup plan could just be sticking to keeping my own space clean and maybe setting some clear boundaries, like not letting their stuff creep into my area. I’d probably also just keep focusing on my own habits and not stress too much about their side if they don’t wanna change, ya know?\ntherapist: That sounds like a solid plan that prioritizes your own well-being while still maintaining a respectful boundary. It might also help to approach the conversation with your roommate as a team effort, focusing on how keeping a tidy space could benefit both of you in terms of reducing stress and making your living environment more enjoyable. How do you think you could frame the conversation to emphasize that teamwork aspect?\nclient: I think I could start by saying something like, hey, I’ve noticed our space gets a bit cluttered and it’s kinda stressing me out, so maybe we can work together to keep it tidier. Like, just throw out a casual idea of both of us picking up after ourselves more, ya know, so it’s not just one of us dealing with it and we both feel better about the room.\ntherapist: That approach sounds thoughtful and collaborative, and framing it as a team effort can help your roommate feel included rather than criticized. It might also be helpful to anticipate potential responses or concerns they might have, so you can address them proactively and show that you're open to finding a solution that works for both of you.\nclient: I guess I could think about how they might say they’re too busy or just not used to sharing a space, and I’d be like, I get it, we can figure out something easy that doesn’t take much time. Maybe suggest small stuff like tossing trash right away or splitting quick cleanups, so it’s not a big deal for either of us, ya know?\ntherapist: That’s a great way to approach the conversation and address potential concerns. By offering flexible solutions like quick cleanups and splitting tasks, you’re showing your roommate that you're considerate of their time and open to finding a compromise that works for both of you.

Also, having a plan to just listen at first, instead of jumping into talking, might make it feel less intense while I get a sense of the group.\nclient: therapist: That sounds like a solid plan to ease yourself into the group dynamic by focusing on listening and reminding yourself of shared interests. How about we check in next session to see how that first step of looking online or preparing questions goes?\n\nclient: Yeah, that sounds good to me. I’ll try to have an update for you by then, even if it’s just a small step forward.","completed":true}

I started in 2016 and took some time off to battle depression. Although it was tough, I won eventually. I decided to go back in 2021 and I have been doing well until now. I find myself questioning the reason I’m here all the time. I don’t know what my ‘Why’ or my true purpose is. I don’t care about being my age in college because how others view me doesn’t matter. I believe that I will finish, I think? If I were not in college, I don’t know what I would be doing with myself but working at a soul sucking job. I am having trouble matching actions with my words and thoughts. I haven’t been studying consistently and I sometimes avoid classes. I am on academic probation again and I just don’t understand why I continue to self sabotage when I claim that I am confident and want to be a college graduate. \n\nI even try to better myself with reading self-help books, talking to my support system, and be more outgoing on campus like joining clubs and going to parties. Parties are played out to me and the clubs are going okay. Atomic habits, reinventing the habit wheel, and meditation have all helped me in short bursts, but I still am having trouble getting my sh*t together. I am starting to feel hopeless. I don’t want to feel hopeless ever again. Last time I felt that way I was deeply depressed. I want to be better than this. How can fight against my negative emotions?

What if you started with just 15 minutes of studying each day, and gradually build up to an hour?\nclient: Hey, yeah, starting with just 15 minutes sounds way less intimidating, like I could probably handle that without freaking out. Do you think I should, like, set a reminder or something to make sure I actually do it, or is there a better way to keep myself on track?\ntherapist: That sounds like a great idea! Setting a reminder can help you stay on track, but you might also want to think about other ways to make this a habit. What if you tried studying at the same time every day, or paired it with something you already do regularly?\nclient: Hey, I like the idea of studying at the same time every day, maybe right after I grab my morning coffee or something, since I’m already up and moving. Do you think tying it to something I’m already doing could really help it stick, or should I try something else to keep myself accountable?\ntherapist: It sounds like tying your study time to your morning coffee routine could be a great strategy, especially since you’re already up and moving. What do you think about also sharing your plan with a friend or family member to keep yourself accountable, or perhaps tracking your progress in a journal to reflect on your success?\nclient: Hey, I think sharing my plan with a friend could be cool, like having someone to check in with might push me to actually follow through. Tracking progress in a journal sounds okay too, but I’m not sure if I’d keep up with it—do you have any tips on making that part easier or more motivating?\ntherapist: That's great to hear that sharing your plan with a friend could work for you! To make journaling more engaging, perhaps you could try jotting down a quick reflection on your progress at the end of each study session, or even use a fun, colorful notebook to make it more enjoyable. How do those ideas sound?\nclient: Hey, I think using a colorful notebook could make journaling a bit more fun, and I’m down to try jotting down quick thoughts after studying. Do you think just writing a sentence or two about how it went would be enough, or should I be more detailed to really get something out of it?\nclient: Hey, I’m cool with starting small, like just a sentence or two about how the study session went, since that feels doable. What do you think about checking in next time to see if that’s working for me, or if I need to tweak it?\nclient: Hey, I’m glad we can touch base next time to see how this journaling thing is going. I’m a bit worried I might slack off, so having that check-in feels like a good safety net—does that sound okay to you?\nclient: Hey, I’m really glad we’ve got that check-in planned too, it definitely helps ease my mind knowing we’ll revisit this. Is there anything else you think I should keep in mind to stay on track until then?","completed":true}

I could go on abt it for days but we don't have time to give a short summary of the vibes: extreme mismanagement of an institution, horrible facilities\/classrooms, no sense of academic integrity, poor teaching, no sort of proper functioning basic 'services' like student welfare or career counselors provided, straight up illegal shit like holding classes in a construction site, the fact that you DON'T HAVE WIFI NOR DOES MOBILE DATA WORK BC NETWORK IS SO BAD on campus, the list goes on.\n\nGetting back to my situation, my first year was online and EVERYONE cheated on EVERYTHING but I didn't know how to so I didn't and ended up with the lower side of decent kinda grades (mainly bc most of the syllabus was geared to start off from what was taught in the Indian curriculum that I obv didn't study and so there were large gaps in my knowledge that I wasn't even aware of). For detail, I averaged a 8.33\/10 CGPA.\n\nIn my 2nd year, we went irl, I got my shit together, worked super hard but bc there is literally no sense of fair grading and cheating is rampant at my uni, so my efforts have only given mediocre results. (I got a 8.73\/10 GPA in that sem, now averaging 8.46). This added with overwork (my uni is 6 days a week, 1 month holiday for summer, 1 week for winter, sometimes we do 7 days a week working and the semesters are back-to-back i.e. after the last day of sem 3, the next day is sem 4), I am super burned out rn with v low morale.\n\n**\\*** I've decided to transfer but I have a v weak application, I only focused on studying and I do computer science so I need projects\/stuff to appear as a suitable candidate. I am generally quiet and mainly focused on self-learning bc of my low-quality classes so my letter of recommendations is also super weak. Ofc i do have potential, i am smart, i am hard working, i am capable. But my situation for the past 2 years has been HORRENDOUS and unfortunately no uni is going to understand that. After all i go to a top10 uni, hundreds of fully capable candidates graduate from there every year and i am the only one making excuses.\n\n**\\*** My only other option is to drop out. But my main priority is to leave India bc I cannot live here on my own like i don't know the language or the customs, etc and unlike every other country i've lived in you can't just google get straight forward answers for things in India which is the only survival method i've learnt. Which basically means if I drop out, I would have to learn computer science on my own and get a job abroad and i've never heard of anyone do that or the prospects of that path so I am super unsure.\n\nThis post has been an absolute mess but if anyone could help i'd appreciate it so so much.","dialogue_total":[{"index":0,"role":"therapist","statement":"Welcome!

What do you think would have made you feel more prepared, if you could go back and do things differently?\nclient: Honestly, I think I would’ve liked to have a better grip on managing my time and stress before diving into college. It’s just been overwhelming trying to figure that out while everything else is happening, you know?\ntherapist: You seem to feel like you’ve been juggling a lot of new challenges all at once, and it sounds like time and stress management have been particularly tough to balance. What does a typical day look like for you right now, and how do you usually handle stress when it feels overwhelming?\nclient: Yeah, my days are kinda all over the place—between classes, assignments, and trying to keep up with friends, I’m just running around a lot. When stress hits hard, I usually just push through or distract myself with my phone, but I know that’s not really working.\ntherapist: It's clear that you've been trying to find ways to manage everything, but it sounds like you might be feeling a bit stuck in the way you're handling stress. Have you ever considered any other strategies that could help you balance everything more effectively?\nclient: Yeah, I’ve thought about trying stuff like making a schedule or maybe even some mindfulness stuff, but I’m not really sure where to start with it. It just feels like one more thing to add to my plate, you know?\ntherapist: I hear you—trying to manage everything and then also figure out new strategies can definitely feel like a lot. If we could imagine a version of you who had mastered time and stress management, what would your days look like then? How would that version of you handle the same situations you're facing now?\nclient: Man, if I had that all figured out, I think my days would feel way more in control—like I’d actually know what I’m doing hour by hour without this constant scramble. That version of me would probably take a step back when stress hits, maybe breathe for a sec or prioritize stuff instead of just freaking out or zoning out.\ntherapist: It sounds like that version of you has some really effective strategies for managing stress and time. You mentioned taking a step back, breathing, and prioritizing tasks—how do you think those strategies might help you feel more in control? What steps could you take to start integrating some of these ideas into your current routine?\nclient: Yeah, I think taking a step back and breathing would help me slow down the chaos in my head, like just giving myself a moment to think straight instead of spiraling. As for prioritizing, it’d probably stop me from feeling so overwhelmed if I could just focus on one thing at a time, and starting small with a simple to-do list or setting aside five minutes to chill could be doable, I guess. What do you think—should I just pick one of those to try first, or is there a better way to ease into it?\ntherapist: It sounds like you're onto something with starting small—maybe try one strategy first and see how it feels? What do you think would be the easiest to try right now, and what might make it feel doable?\nclient: Honestly, I think starting with just taking a few minutes to breathe when I’m feeling overwhelmed might be the easiest to kick off with. It doesn’t require much planning, and I can do it pretty much anywhere, so maybe setting a reminder on my phone to pause once or twice a day could help make it stick.\ntherapist: That sounds like a great starting point, and setting reminders on your phone could be a helpful way to make it a habit. What do you think might make those reminders feel more effective for you?\nclient: I guess making the reminders kinda specific, like setting them for times I know I’m usually stressed—like right after a big class or when I’m starting to study. Maybe even adding a little note in the reminder, like “just breathe for a sec,” could nudge me to actually do it instead of ignoring it.\nclient: That’s a solid idea to tailor the reminders to specific stressful moments. Do you think having a particular spot or routine, like stepping outside for a breather, could help reinforce it even more?","completed":true}
