  "concern": "Hi! First post on this sub, and it’s such a crazy story.\n\nThis last semester (1st year, out of state) I was rooming with one of my good friends, at a small private university. \n\nWe walk into our dorm together and bam, a single queen sized bed in a room meant for two people? Previous resident lived alone and somehow the original beds got taken away, and there was a very nice queen sized bed (that didn’t match). Also we noticed the desk is odd, is less than foot wide and spans the entire length of one wall. It was nonfunctional it was so skinny.\n\nSo after we see our room we go to find our RA, and we ask her what in the world was up with our room. She said our two twin beds got moved to another room that caught on fire so they are going to get more. Lovely. Also, they couldn’t move the horrible desk because it would damage the floor since it was bolted to the floor??????\n\nWell, since we are so far out of state we can’t exactly go home. We ended up having the share the bed (thank goodness it was a good friend of mine). That lasted for a whole TWO WEEKS. Everyday we talked to someone about it, absolutely nothing. Until two weeks later they say they finally have two twins.\n\nAlso, we ended up being allowed to bring in a desk from the library that they weren’t using, because ours couldn’t hold a single laptop. It was bad.\n\nBy the end of the whole ordeal when our room was completely usable, (and we didn’t have to share a bed) we went to talk to these people (don’t know their positions). My roommate/friend and I basically pitched a fit about how there should have been two beds in that room, and it probably violated a code somewhere. We ended up not having to pay full room and board for the issues we had.\n\nIt was a mess, we pulled through and won’t be staying on campus again.",
