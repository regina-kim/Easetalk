  "concern": "This is in th USA. I am a mid career professional who has enrolled back in university to learn a new language. In the past year and a half, I have progressed to 4th year level classes. I dont intend to get a degree, and if I do, it has nothing to do with my carrer, which I will not be changing. I am doing this purely because I want to learn this language and become fluent. \n\nHowever this upcoming term, I have to travel for personal reasons and I wont be able to finish the term.  I already know this. But I also dont want to take such a long break from the language, for fear for losing it. The winter break was already over a month long. Also, this is an expensive endeavor since my status doesnt qualify me for any financial aid and I am paying for it all out of pocket. So I'd hate to pay for the whole term and only be able to attend a third.\n\nI'd like to talk to the professor and ask if I can just sit in on her class, without officially being on the roster, and attending as long as possible. How terrible an idea is this?\n\nFWIW, I did take a 3rd year class with this prof, so she knows me. But its hard to say how well she remembers me.",
