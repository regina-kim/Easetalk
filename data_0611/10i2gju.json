  "concern": "I’m currently an undergraduate student with a year and a half left till graduation. I’m not happy in my current research lab, the research doesn’t interest me and I don’t feel passionate about it. I’d been here for a semester (previous semester) and realized how I took this lab in a rush because I’d just left my previous lab due to having a toxic PI. I will be talking to my current PI about wanting to leave, and now have a direction of my true passion/research interests (microbio and immuno). I reached out to PIs of interest in this department and so far, 4 have said that they’re full and to come back in the summer, while 3 offered me interviews.. I spoke with my mentor in my research program and she told me how 2 out of those three are poor mentors and I would be sucked dry with the hours they’ll give me, while she doesn’t know anything about the third. I will be meeting with them to gage, but I feel that my options so far are limited. There’s still more PIs to hear from that haven’t responded, but I’m at a loss on what to do… Should I start this semester or wait in the summer to increase my options? I’m thinking about responding to those who replied with a request to rotate, I really want to be in a good lab environment. With this said, I will be leaving current lab irrespective of whether I start a new lab for this semester or not. Another thing is I’m not sure how to go about the PIs who haven’t responded yet, I understand that they’re EXTREMELY busy, but alot of the times they don’t see the students’ email because of the sheer volume of emails they have. How long do I give it before I email again (if, at all?) for context, I emailed this past Thursday/Friday, which I know is SO RECENT, but just for a rule o thumb. All thoughts would be appreciated towards this, thank you all❤️",
