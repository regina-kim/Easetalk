  "concern": "Hey y’all I was wondering if the plan I came up with is a good one regarding my dismissal appeal and also just in general to help improve myself academically rather I stay at the university I’m at or have to go somewhere else. \n\nThe plan I’ve developed over the last week is this:\n\n1. Meet with my academic advisor to discuss the best plan of action to recover my poor GPA this includes likes what courses I should retake and if I should take a different course instead.(this step would be for if I’m retained)\n\n2. I want to receive academic coaching from the Academic support center for time management skills and how to ease exam anxiety.\n\n3. At the same time I want to set up individual counseling sessions over at the counseling center to help cope with my mental health without impacting my academics.\n\n4. Lastly would be to send off letters for accommodations to every professor at the beginning of the semester from the DRC. \n\n\nThis plan isn’t just for the appeal letter but for anywhere I would go to I want to do so I can be academically successful.\n\nThanks",
