  "concern": "This always seems to happen Spring semester, really hard for me to motivate myself to go to class and even harder to get homework done or get started on it at all. Not sure why Fall semester always goes great and then Spring feels so dreadful. Any ideas on how to correct this habit before it’s too late? Anything that’s worked for you guys? Trying to work on my discipline and slowly get better at it but I’m worried I might be in too deep to finish this semester off strong.",
