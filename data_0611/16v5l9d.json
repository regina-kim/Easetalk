  "concern": "So, I know this is a stupid question, but I just need reassurance. If a professor signs their emails with their first name, is it appropriate to address them this way?\n\nFor context, I've recently started doing research with a professor, and she's been signing her emails to me and other lab volunteers with her first name. I'm assuming that means I should be addressing emails to her that way, but it still just feels kind of weird to me.\n\nEdit: Thanks all for the help!",
