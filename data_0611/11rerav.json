I want to go get a bachelors in Computer Science, and I have applied to my local community college and will start in the fall of this year. Ive not registered for classes yet. I do see that I will take Calculus 1. I am very scared of taking this. How exactly do I prepare for this? I dont remember much of math from high school. Thank you",
