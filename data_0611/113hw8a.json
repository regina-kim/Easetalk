I always feel like people look at me and no one ever talks to me. I’ve had small conversations with some of my peers, but they really only seem interested in talking for school purposes. Sometimes I feel crazy and actually really frustrated that no one seems to relate to me. It’s an awful, lonely feeling. What should I do?",
