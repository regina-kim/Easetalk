  "concern": "I am a music major and I am taking a music history class that covers  the Classical and Romantic eras which is a time I am interested in. However, my professor has not given a single lecture talking about notable styles, background of well known composers, general history you know. For most of the semester, we have been talking about Wikipedia... like how to edit, create and revise an article. The professor is unusually passionate about Wikipedia and wanting it to be used more often in academia. At the beginning, the class was told that she was going to cover underrepresented composers and all that but never did... Even for one of our quizzes, there was no study guide provided, essentially had to use the Wikipedia articles she had posted and studied through those but some of these articles were long and obscured what we had to know. I was looking forward to this class and now very disappointed that we did not cover pretty much what the class is supposed to be about.\n\nAll students at my uni provide a course evaluation at the end of the semester. So in short, do the higher ups take these evaluations seriously despite a professor being tenured, do these evaluations do anything?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
