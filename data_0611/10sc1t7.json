  "concern": "I have a professor who assigns assignments due on Monday, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at all 6pm. I work Mon - Friday 9am-5pm, during my lunch I try to take notes since this is a science class but his PowerPoints range from 45-100 pages per chapter. With my hours it’s hard to complete these assignments at 6. I am trying to complete the assignments the days before it’s due to reduce stress but as life has it, it doesn’t always work that way. This is the only class I have ever stressed this much about and tried talking to the professor but came to no avail. (I asked for an extension for 1 assignment since it was only going to be an hour late). It is also an online class. Is there someone in the school I can talk to about this to help accommodate the working students ? He does open the assignments the day before it is due.",
