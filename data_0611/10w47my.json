  "concern": "Right now it all feels pointless because I'm only taking gen ed classes, and I feel like I'd have learned way more if I job shadowed the entire year. It all just feels like busywork, and next year will be mostly the same until I meet all of the prerequisites for classes in my major. \n\nI recently heard the term \"weeder classes\" where they're unnecessarily hard on purpose to weed people out of a major/collegeâ€”is that what the first two years are? Does it get easier/more fulfilling later on? Maybe I just don't have the normal veil of excitement/first time having autonomy because I took two years off between high school and college, so I'm coming in at 20yo with a little more real world experience?\n\nI'm tired. I spend 10 hours of my life every week driving to and from campus, all for classes that are BS and not related to what I want to be doing at all. I hate that college is what you \"need\" to do to get a well paying job outside of skilled trades/customer service (not to say those are bad fields, they're just not for me. I did my time in retail and I don't have the physicality needed for the trades)",
