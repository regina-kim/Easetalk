  "concern": "I'm a second year college student at a college in NY, Jan 24 was the last day to register for classes, and i couldn't register because my account is on hold. I tried to email anyone who can help me but no response, now I'm afraid that i won't be attending the 2023 spring semester. I tried to let my advisor know before the deadline what classes i have to take, but i got no response. I'm planning on calling the administration office in the morning to explain what happened, I'm worried that they'll say i can't register anymore, idk what to tell my parents if i don't attend the semester, do you guys think they'll let me register for the semester? Is there any other way i can fix this?",
