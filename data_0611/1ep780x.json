  "concern": "TW for mention of sexual assault\n\nMy intro to psychology class is online through a program called OLI where our instructor assigns us 3-4 modules a week to read and then take quizzes on. The past two weeks, two separate modules have had a short section at the beginning where it's a story from someone. Only three out of 19 modules have had these stories added to them, and two of them were about violent SA. Both of these triggered me and caused me to have to take breaks from my work due to past trauma that I'm currently in therapy for.\n\nThe first one was a woman talking about her PTSD from a violent sexual assault, how she'll never be the same but found treatment. This was at the beginning of a chapter about classical conditioning terminology and specifically Pavlov's dogs.\n\nThe second one was another woman talking about her violent assault and how she caused a man to be wrongfully convicted for 11 years because of source monitoring. This led into a chapter about source monitoring and memory, which is admittedly more relevant to the curriculum than the previous one.\n\nI have went through filing an official grievance complaint about a previous online class and instructor before and it took a mental toll on me so I'm on the fence about reporting something like that again. I'm also stuck on whether or not it's valid to be triggered by this because I hear people say that the world isn't responsible for my triggers, I'm responsible for learning how to cope with them (which I do but still think TW are helpful, harm reducing and kind). I just think it's unnecessary to use these types of stories when it could be conveyed with something less graphic and more relevant to the curriculum. Is it worth going to the teacher about and expressing TW could be useful in the future?\n\nedit: I've had an instructor in the past put trigger warnings on their assignments very diligently, and tell us that if we're uncomfortable with the material to come to them and they'd figure something else out. Also encouraged us to leave class if we were uncomfortable or triggered with discussions.\n\nedit2: I also go to a VERY small community college. All classes have 15 people at most, usually less. It's easy to have student/teacher interaction and I've seen many students form personal friendships with instructors too",
