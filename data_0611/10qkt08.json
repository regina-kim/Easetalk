  "concern": "After basically getting through college and high school running on what I presume was the last of my motivation, I \\[F26\\] got my bachelors in biology, and after a couple jobs have landed in a place where I'm happy, but need to get a raise. Going back to school for a masters never really was an option for me and isn't really something I'd like to pursue, but I decided to try taking some certificate CC classes in an effort to boost my skills to either get a raise or a better job.\n\nHence... now I'm 2 weeks into class, and I just... can't. I never was able to focus well, and basically got through college by hyperfixating on my studies and \\*school was my life\\* but that doesn't work when you're a grown up and have outside obligations like a full time job and being a healthy human for the first time in my life. I tried putting in what I assumed was the amount of effort that normal people put into school (I did the readings, the lectures, the assignment), and still failed my first assignment and I feel so discouraged at the moment.\n\nHow do I focus and figure out how to \"absorb\" information in ways other than letting school consume my life... I'm seriously super close to just dropping out and never looking back at school but it feels like it might be my only option to eventually get the salary I want.",
