  "concern": "Final year of college seems like I am unable to grasp any information from any of my professor. I go to class daily, take notes, and also listen to them and don't get me wrong, they are wonderful. I just don't understand why I am unable to remember or comprehending some important stuff that is needed for midterms/finals. Like my professor taught us something 2 days ago and picks on me to answer and knowing that I've learnt it, I cannot answer their questions. The fear of dropping my gpa is getting way into my mind as my midterms are nearing. My question is how did you guys deal with this? and/or am I doing something wrong?",
