  "concern": "basically, I’m set to finish CC by Spring 2024, but I want to take a certificate in pre-law, but I’d need to add 3 (or 5, depending on if I want to add the recommended courses) more classes into my student plan if I want to actually do that. I already did my SEP for Spring, Summer, and Fall 2023, as well as my last semester being Spring 2024. Each classes (including this term) has 12 units, Summer has 9 and the rest have 12. Do you think it’s worth squeezing those 3 extra classes in order to get the certificate? Also, if I do take those classes, can they be considered transferrable even if they weren’t part of my major? TIA!",
