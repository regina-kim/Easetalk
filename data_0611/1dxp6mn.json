  "concern": "So I'm going for engineeeing (specifically computer or electrical) but I also love microeconomics and investing. It's just cool to me and I'm great at managing money. If possible, I would consider later in life working as a portfolio manager for a firm or some type of microeconomics career. I of course want to do engineering first but maybe I can do both and find a way to tie them together.\n\nHas anyone done the two? If so, how did you manage and do you still think it was a good choice?",
