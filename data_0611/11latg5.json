  "concern": "I have to write an 8 page paper in the next couple days, and I need to be able to focus. I prefer doing homework in coffee shops, but they can be loud, and I am easily distracted by voices and weird sounds. I usually put in my AirPods to cancel out sound, but it’s not enough. Does anyone have any Spotify playlists or songs they listen to in order to help them focus and get their work done? I can’t listen to music with words or upbeat music because I won’t be able to focus. I’ve tried white noise such as a fan or rain, but I don’t really like it. I’m looking for specifically music suggestions that have worked for others who have a difficult time focusing. Thank you!!",
