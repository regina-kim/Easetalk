  "concern": "I had an absolutely awful semester in regards to my grades. I took 5 classes and did either horribly or just enough to get by. At some point I just felt burnt out and didn’t go to class for 2-3 weeks. I had 18 absences in a single class. In another I stopped going after the 4th week. \n\nThe last time I checked canvas I had passing grades in 4. But I’m not sure if that will reflect in my final grades. Normally it’s after you’ve missed the equivalent of two weeks of class you fail but I’ve missed more than that and passed before. \n\nLast semester I had my highest gpa yet and to see myself fail and crumble the following semester has been really disheartening. I’m not sure what to do for the following semester and what to do if it turns out I failed my classes this semester.",
