  "concern": "I currently have somewhere around 6-8 assignments due today/tomorrow. I've known this since Monday and I swear the time flew by like nothing. Everything just feels like too much to do and too overwhelming. A few assignments are hw that are also kind of like study guides for an exam I have later this week. Not quite sure how to overcome this, I've spent most of this weekend sitting at my laptop to do homework but instead just staring at it doing nothing, or finding something else to do on my laptop. I was up until 3am last night organizing photos and files on my laptop because I thought after that I'd feel ready for the homework but it did not work out like that.",
