  "concern": "I (30M) recently re-entered college as a mature international student in a foreign country. Been here a month.\n\nThe first 2 weeks, I hung around with bunch of international students from Asia. But over time, I felt different from them (18-22 year olds) and started sitting apart from them as I couldn't relate (they only talk about study and stick to themselves, they don't integrate at all with the locals).\n\nThe local students too are mainly 18-21 years old.\n\nRaised in several countries as a kid, I feel too Asian for the (mainly 18-21 y/old) local students, and too Westernized culturally for the international Asian students. I'm older at 30 than people in both. Other mature students? There's only 1 who talks about study all the time. Due to age and being racially different, I feel I don't fit in anywhere.\n\nI ended up sitting in lectures alone by myself again, and have begun to feel down after a few incidents:\n\n1. Group conversation with a few local students that made eye contact with each other but not with me. I feel they don't want to talk to me, I get quieter more withdrawn; they look less at me and talk more with themselves; I felt hurt and made an excuse to leave.\n2. A classmate who's loud and swears a lot made racist comments about Indian and old white men (she's white herself); I called her out and then she started to argue with me, saying, patronizingly '*you're so pure and innocent*'. I defended myself. We met again today, talked about another topic, she wanted to argue again. My blood pressure rose again.\n3. I asked a younger student a question about exam content and they were sarcastic and rude to me; '*Oh, you didn't read the online announcement...? Because it was posted there... you know*.' with an arrogant expression. Anger I really had to suppress.\n\nWhen I arrived here, I was positive and social. Now; after every failed interaction/real/perceived rejection, and trying to socialize whilst focusing on the intensity of the course (studying 8 hours a day including Saturdays) I feel more weary and the people who were either rude or ignored me I feel anger towards and do not want to talk with anymore. These people are on a course with me for the next five years.\n\nI feel on the outside looking in. I'm way older at 30 here and, as I sit on the outside of these local and international student groups in class, who talk amongst themselves, I go back home to my room alone. I play guitar alone. I feel intense sadness and frustration, like, just for one day I wish I could disappear. I've joined a few Meetup groups but they start next week.\n\nI feel like I want to drop out of this course so I don't have to deal with this anymore. What can I do?",
