  "concern": "[Link to the YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ProfessorLeonard). This channel has saved my life over the past few months going through Calculus 1 and 2 and Prof. Leonard has seriously lifted the \"I'm bad at math\" stigma that I have always held. I've gone from hating math and being afraid of it to actually enjoying learning it and it's become a passion of mine.\n\nHe has lectures from Prealgebra all the way to Differential Equations that are complete, in-depth, and worked with a ton of examples. He emphasizes that \"why\" and the \"how\" extremely well which is something that you don't generally get. His lectures are always slow and he makes sure that his students understand every bit of the material and never skips steps.",
