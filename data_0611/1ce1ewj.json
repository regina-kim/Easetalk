  "concern": "\nHey guys, recently turned 22 am currently a junior in university . I am currently unemployed and haven't had a job only had 2 jobs in my life and had done doordash sometimes. I recently started working out and have been doing more house chores and helping my mom with the house. Picking up my siblings and dropping them off at school. I live at home which I am thankful. So I maintain the house like mopping and washing dishes. Doing errands. \n\n I hang out with my gf almost everyday and play video games for a couple hours. I was wondering how I could be more productive and feel useful. I feel like im a mooch or a no life without a part time job. Me and my gf go out a lot and explore new areas. I feel like my family thinks im lazy. Even though I know im just finishing this semester and still got one year left for my bachelors. ",
