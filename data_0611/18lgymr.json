  "concern": "I have tried as hard as I can to get my associates and get ready for transferring to university without taking on any debt. I have my associates now and my grandmother has been covering everything that the Pell Grant doesn't cover, however I now have to go to a university to finish up my degree. I am running into the same thing that gave me massive anxiety the last time though. I am going to have to take out loans to pay for my classes, unless my grandmother can cover a whole lot more than I think she can. The idea of taking out loans terrifies me but I also cannot continue to work at low wage, horrible jobs for the rest of my life. How do you deal with that dichotomy? ",
