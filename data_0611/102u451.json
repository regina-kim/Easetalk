The fact of not knowing what to do is heavily stressing me out and is stopping me from even looking at grants much less applications. \n\nThe fact that I didn’t do too well in high school so far is stressing me out as well and want to be something more than I am but can’t because of my past self.\n\nI’ve been leaning on different things since my freshman year of high school and still don’t know what. I’m a senior. I’ve hit a wall and feel like my life is gonna just wreck if I don’t make a decision within a week and a half. \n\nFor anyone else who ran into the situation but successfully made it, what did you do?
