  "concern": "Ok before everyone gets all crazy I was dealing with a lot of family issues (health related) so I have been traveling home every weekend basically. Anyways this is an online class that usually has 2 papers due over the weekend. I got so insanely behind in work bc of all this. I hate asking to accept late work because it seems so entitled but she has no information on late work in the syllabus so I’m wondering if it’s worth a shot. She seems really nice and always enjoys when I actually turn in work. I guess I’m just wondering what the best way to go about this is and how to even ask her if it’s possible. ",
