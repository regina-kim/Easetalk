  "concern": "I just wanted to hear other people's experiences or opinions. I am about to study abroad and the master's degree I'm going to do is quite small, 45 places divided into three tracks. I guess I'm scared that my track will be the least popular and I will be in class with 5 other people or something. The lectures are all three hours long in the evening (ending 22:00 latest). I can imagine that it would be either quite awkward if the prof's just speaking to 4 people for 3 hours, or it will be very interactive maybe.\n\n  \nHas anyone taken three hour lectures with such a small class size? How was it? ",
