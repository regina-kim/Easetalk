I figured I'd get the foot in the door and get my associates in History out of the way...but I have to take the Florida Civic Literacy Exam before I can graduate. I've completed a previous degree in American Sign Language at my old college. \n\nI'm registered to take the test on Wednesday; how easy is it to pass? I do NOT test well. Any advice? Thank you!",
