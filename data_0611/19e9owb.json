  "concern": "I’m taking a herpetology class right now. It’s required for my degree. It’s a “hybrid” class (the only thing they offer for this class now since COVID). The class is exclusively graded on online discussions and three exams. The discussions are based on the chapters we read in the book… ALL of the chapters. Like the whole book front to back is the curriculum. The chapters are 30+ pages. It’s been a week and I’m only on page 19 of chapter 1 which is 33 pages. It’s a very complex read with a lot of scientific terms and I can only read short chunks at a time. I’m taking notes and highlighting as I go because I need to understand what I’m reading but I feel like I’m going to fall behind in this class because of this. We only meet in class once a week and are expected to have the chapters read for that lesson prior to class.",
