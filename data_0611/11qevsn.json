I always assumed that you were supposed to earn your associates first, and then apply to transfer to a four year, but recently I've seen a lot of people who transferred without getting their associates midway into their sophomore year. If I've managed to finish all of my Gen Ed classes for my chosen degree, is there any point in waiting to graduate to transfer? Do I gain anything by transferring with an associates degree?",
