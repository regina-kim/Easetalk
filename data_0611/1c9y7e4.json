  "concern": "It's April, and I'm set to start college in the fall. Initially, I planned on pursuing criminal justice, but lately, I've discovered my passion for aviation, mainly being a pilot, and my college doesn’t offer anything aviation related. I wish I had explored flight programs earlier, like those at Purdue and Embry-Riddle. Now I'm stuck, should I stick with my current college choice and transfer later, go to community college for prerequisites then apply after, or just wait for application cycles to open again. Any advice or similar experiences out there?",
