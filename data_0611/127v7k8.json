  "concern": "Hi, first-gen college student here. I'm graduating in May and have multiple stoles, tassels, and cords from 3 honor societies and the summa cum laude tassel. In other peoples graduation photos, I've seen most people wearing one stole, one or two cords if they have any, and one or two tassels. If you have multiple, is it appropriate to wear more than one, or do you have to pick only one? My parents want me to wear *all* of the regalia, but I don't want to look silly or over-the-top if that's not how it's supposed to be worn. Thanks!",
