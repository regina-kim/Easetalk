She thinks that this would be great and definitely fit my personality ðŸ™„ \n\nI don't think so! \n\nMarketing has everything I looooove. \n\n- Writing \n- Research\n- Designing\n- Technology \n- People that I can talk to \n\nAll in all I get to be my most creative self in Marketing with the time crunches sprinkled on the side. Macroeconomics doesn't allow me to embrace photography or be my feminine self. \n\nTotally no hard feelings to my fellow nerds who love numbers and making the world a better place inspite of scarcity but, while I love helping people... it's a no for me.",
