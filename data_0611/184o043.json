  "concern": "I have been paying my adult child’s rent  (22 and working full time for the past month, and in college part time)for a variety of reasons.  I recently asked him to see his bank accounts because his apartment lease is coming due in the next couple of months and I am trying to create a balance with him paying some of the rent and me paying some.  He doesn’t want to show me his finances or give me user name or passwords for his accounts.  Since I am not able to get him to share  any information to assist with budgeting purposes, he will be on his own when the lease is up. Am I being unreasonable to ask him for his financial information or user name and password to accounts so we can discuss a budget?  I have been asking for over 6 months and I keep getting excuses as to why he can’t give me the information.",
