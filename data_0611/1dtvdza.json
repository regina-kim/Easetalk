No matter how hard I try, my grades in chemistry, physics, etc. are abysmal. I've never failed classes before. Meanwhile it feels like everyone else is succeeding. Now I have two Fs on my transcript and I feel like I've screwed everything up. I'm thinking about changing my major don't know what to do with this low GPA. I'm pretty sure I've screwed my chances of transferring :( ",
