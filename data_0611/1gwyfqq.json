  "concern": "Hello all. I am a current student at a community college and I am seeking to transfer to a four year early. I applied to Boise State and afterwards decided to do some more research and noted that there was blatant racism on campus according to niche. I am a black student and this is very concerning to me, but according ro the reviews there hasn't been any incidents in the last 3 years or so. Can anyone tell me their opinion on Boise State? Also since I applied they have been moving like molasses! Only updating transcripts they've gotten every 10 days. Any help would be appreciated thanks!",
