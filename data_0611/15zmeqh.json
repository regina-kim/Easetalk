  "concern": "Im starting my 3rd year in a few days and feel even more scared than i did on my first day. Looking back i thought I would’ve figured out who i was or what i wanted to be\\ do by now but I couldn’t even be further from that. i have made zero friends and connections . I haven’t interned anywhere, I haven’t been involved in any extracurriculars. My gpa has dropped tremendously this past year for putting my mental health as a priority and starting medication for anxiety and depression which has helped me put less strain and stress on myself but i guess my grades payed in result of that. Im not good or enjoy what I’m studying (which is CS ) but I haven’t got an option to transfer and even if i did i have no passion or desire to study anything else . i feel pressured to correct the course my life is going down but I’m terrified I’m going to burn out. I can’t even imagine what my life is going to look like post graduating because i have no goal or passion to pursue even. Can someone tell me its going to be okay ? Or give me any advice on how to better the situation Im in?",
