  "concern": "So, the financial aid awards just came out for UC. The total cost for attendance is 41k a year. However, my EFC is 44k, so I get no aid. Does this mean I could only pay for one year of college? What pisses me off right now is how close my EFC is to the cost of attendance. What should I do now? Maybe I'm just stressing for no reason since this is my first year, if so, please tell me.",
