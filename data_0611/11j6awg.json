  "concern": "Y’all. I’m finally done with community college @29Yrs old. Long story short. I had to work when I graduated high school to help maintain my family’s standard of living. \n\nI paid my tuition out of pocket until 25 and studied part time. I’m finally done. \n\nI need the advice as if I was ur son or younger brother about transferring to university. I literally don’t have anyone to give me advice about leaving home to study. \n\nI only THINK I wanna double major in philosophy and political science. \n\nBut regards to where Idk how to start. \n\nWhat limits me? Is it money? \n\nI just know I wanna work part time and study part time of possible. I’ll adjust if I have to. \n\nWhat should be realistic about my dreams? Is it distance from home? Tuition prices? Should I look at career options before doubling down on major? Because I honestly don’t know what I want to do to. I only been surviving off plowing snow and working jobs that would hire me. \n\n I have a 3.3 GPA and a decent resume along with awards from writing competitions. \n\nI’m sorry I’m scrambled. I just have little guidance when it comes to the college life.",
