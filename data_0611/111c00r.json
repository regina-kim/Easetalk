  "concern": "I have space for 2 electives in the next year before I graduate with my BA. It costs the same, so might as well get the bang for my buck. I have taken a ton of social science and music courses, but not a lot of practical job skills. \n\nNotably, I have chemistry, nutrition, college algebra, stats for decision making in business, severa writing courses and interpersonal communication under my belt. \n\nWhat else could I take? Are there computer skills I should have? Legal skills? Should I have a basic psychology class? \n\nFor reference, I have little idea what I want to do with my future. But I’m thinking a Master’s in business admin, public health, social work or law school.\n\nI want to work somewhere that means something to me. Probably non-profit work or a business that I am actually passionate about. \n\nAny recommendations for those two electives? I mostly care about valuable skills/future transferable credits.",
