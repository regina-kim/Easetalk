  "concern": "Up until this past weekend, I lived on campus with my girlfriend and a couple of roommates.  Unfortunately, one of my roommates died in her bedroom over the weekend.  She was an older student with a bunch of health issues, and had temporarily died/had serious medical emergencies many times in the apartment previously.  These situations got to be so stressful that me, my girlfriend, and our other roommate have been going to therapy appointments on campus to try and process everything, and I fell behind on my classes. The other roommates and I had raised concerns to the housing department about living with her, the stress we were under being in this situation, and feeling like we were medically responsible for her.  The college said we were not responsible for her, but their actions and things they’ve said behind our backs say otherwise.  For example, my roommate who passed away and my girlfriend were relocated to temporary housing before finals due to a pipe burst; the roommate later told me and my girlfriend that the assistant director of housing called her and asked if anyone was staying with her that night, as she (assistant director) was uncomfortable with her living someplace by herself (my girlfriend had decided to not stay in the temporary housing). Roommate’s husband was staying with her that night on a visit, which was satisfactory to the assistant director.  The college as a whole had told us multiple times prior to our roommate dying that they were working on a solution, but nothing happened until after she died. When she was alive, we were only asked once to provide input about what we wanted to have happen and were told in that meeting it was best for her to stay living with us because if they moved her to a different apartment she would traumatize more students.  Housing also said they were uncomfortable moving the rest of us to different apartments because then our roommate would be alone and no one would be able to call for medical assistance if she needed it, and that they couldn’t kick her out of housing just because she had health issues.  After months of getting run around by housing and other departments, my roommate died in the apartment, and the school hasn’t done anything to help the rest of us deal with the past few months beyond telling us sorry that she died, telling us that counseling exists, and moving me and my girlfriend into a new apartment.  I’m very frustrated that I was put into and forced to stay in this situation for as long as I was. Surely there were things the college could have done to let my roommate stay living on campus while making sure she was staying safe (letting her have a care attendant or having her live with an RA are two options that come to mind).  My parents are saying legal action is warranted in this situation and that I should try and get the school to reimburse my housing costs for the year, but I wanted to get some input from others before I decide what I’m going to do.  Is there anything I can or should reasonably ask my college to do to make up for me being kept this situation?  Is legal action necessary?",
